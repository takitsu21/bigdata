B005FUKW6M|19791209303728|'4.0,I am very pleased with the set. I almost changed my mind about ordering it after reading a few reviews from serious players about the board not being good enough. Which I concede there\\s always something better, this is as good of a board as I have ever used and I have no issues with it at all (thinner wires, which you don\\t see very often would be my only wish).The cabinet is very nice... again, you\\re not paying for a $500 hand-laquered mahogany case built by a skilled craftsman, but you\\re getting a nice looking, decent quality wood case that looks great in your den (or in my case, the living room that\\s being converted to &#34;pub&#34; style).The darts are much better quality than you get in a typical starter set - they have a nice weight and design and work well. Unfortunately, one of the darts has a slightly bent flight holder and the flight pops out on every-other throw. The two sets also look almost identical - a more obvious distinction between the flights would have been nice. I will probably replace the darts with ones that better suit my personal taste, but they are not bad.At the Black Friday additional discount I got, I have no regrets at all. At the slightly higher normal price, it still seems like a pretty good deal, especially considering you could spend the same amount for the case alone.'

B003D9RBMU|2199023259985|'1.0,First of all let me say that I love Condor products. I own a few of their knives, an axe and a machete. For the price they can\t be beat. They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'
B003D9RBMU|4398046512372|'5.0,Man....I can\\t believe this only cost $25 bucks. The handle was flush, I cut myself taking it out of the wrapper. Condor must have a stock of dead cows because their sheath is more than thick enough to hold the knife. I\\m still speechless, after a few months of use, I can\\t begin to wrap my head around the other knives this size that I\\ve paid for. I\\ve used this at a few outdoor skills classes too, and everyone wants to borrow it.  Sharp edge, flush handle, custom looking craftsmanship.A+'
B003D9RBMU|6597069772375|'5.0,I love this little knife. The only thing I would change is a better grip or way your hand won\t slide onto the blade under certain conditions. Otherwise, this is a great camp knife for all your utility purposes. Does very well at feather sticks and some fine carving. Certainly not meant for firewood processing but all in all a very useful addition to my kit. I do carry a number of knives for different purposes and as spares when weight is not an issue.The knife came awesomely sharp out of the box.and put to use immediately. I have not had the chance to put it though more vigorous testing but will add to this review when I am able.Meantime, I do recommend this knife as a good knife for light duty camp chores.UPDATE:After using this knife which is excellent and has performed flawlessly for a while now I have to add a negative point regarding the very well made but much to big sheath. While being made of excellent quality leather and well crafted the sheath does not fit the knife at all and is just way to big allowing the knife to continually fall or pop out. It bounces around in the sheath and can just pop out if you are on a run or climb so I will have to do some modification to the sheath to get it to stay in the sheath. Very poor job on the fit of this sheath and certain;y a problem with quality control. Whoever passed that through should be fired.'
B003D9RBMU|10995116287208|"'5.0,Mine wasn\t super sharp out of the box but it didn\t take much to make it shaving sharp. I laquered the handle a couple of times and it goes backpacking,hiking,bushcrafting,and camping with me. Blades thicker than a Mora and full tang. Not a chopper but you can baton the living piss out of it and it looks no worse for wear.  Sheath is\"\"AWESOME\"\",if you like leather, which I do. German designed blade made in El Salvador. I couldn\\\\t recommend this enough for the money, great bushcrafting knife. Try one!'"
B003D9RBMU|17592186051011|'5.0,I wanted a full tang Mora and that\s what this is. It\s slightly thicker than the Mora Heavy Duty but basically the same profile and grind. Great knife. Very dependable. I\m probably going to get a custom kydex sheath for it in the cold steel style of sheaths. Love those Cold Steel sheaths!'
B003D9RBMU|19791209302486|'4.0,This knife is better than I was expecting being so cheap in comparison with similar knives.  There is noticeable machining marks on the wood but I have been pretty rough with it anyways so its not a big concern.  The factory sharpening was lacking, be prepared to give it a quick once over right away, but once sharp, it holds its edge for quite some time due to the grind.  I would recommend keeping the knife lightly oiled when not in use because 1075 high carbon steel is not rust resistant, however, it throws a nice shower of sparks off my ferro rod where. The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'

And there\s actually a little bit of history behind the company. For around 20 dollars this knife is a steal. Great durability, awesome sheath, unique blade grind. The sharpness out of the box isn\t top notch, but for the duties that a bushcraft knife does, you should be prepared to sharpen it often anyways.Going back to the sheath, I\m going to say it\s worth 20 dollars by itself. It\s nothing fancy but just a nice quality that you don\t often see. The leather smells great too, even with age. The blade looks great too, mine had a blued swirl finish which hasn\t worn off yet. The handle is simple but sturdy.If I had to give 1 con it would be that the knife slightly resembles a steak knife, but that doesn\t bother me.'

The sheath , as always , is top notch and worth the price of the knife. I may buy another one of these , just to use the sheath for a Mora. The knife is in fact similar to a Mora. But , I think with the width being more narrow , I should get a better cut for carving. I will update as soon as I have a chance to compare the two.'

The factory sharpening was lacking, be prepared to give it a quick once over right away, but once sharp, it holds its edge for quite some time due to the grind.  I would recommend keeping the knife lightly oiled when not in use because 1075 high carbon steel is not rust resistant, however, it throws a nice shower of sparks off my ferro rod where. The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'

B003D9RBMU|2199023257365|'4.0,I havent used it yet , but , it seems like the other Condor knives I own. The steel is good , the grind is slightly uneven. The handle is smooth and well shaped. The sheath , as always , is top notch and worth the price of the knife. I may buy another one of these , just to use the sheath for a Mora. The knife is in fact similar to a Mora. But , I think with the width being more narrow , I should get a better cut for carving. I will update as soon as I have a chance to compare the two.'
B003D9RBMU|13194139539537|'4.0,i bought this knife because i\m a big fan of condor products. the knife itself is knife despite coming dull. the handles are a nice red color and with a little bit of linseed oil they look great. the sheath is nice thick leather, a bit unsightly, but still functional. unfortunately, the retention is horrible. there is about a half an inch of extra space left un-sewn making the sheath\s grip on the knife almost unnoticeable. i sewed this closed to add retention and now it\s a decent package.'
B003D9RBMU|13194139539868|'5.0,I love this little knife. The only thing I would change is a better grip or way your hand won\t slide onto the blade under certain conditions. Otherwise, this is a great camp knife for all your utility purposes. Does very well at feather sticks and some fine carving. Certainly not meant for firewood processing but all in all a very useful addition to my kit. I do carry a number of knives for different purposes and as spares when weight is not an issue.The knife came awesomely sharp out of the box.and put to use immediately. I have not had the chance to put it though more vigorous testing but will add to this review when I am able.Meantime, I do recommend this knife as a good knife for light duty camp chores.UPDATE:After using this knife which is excellent and has performed flawlessly for a while now I have to add a negative point regarding the very well made but much to big sheath. While being made of excellent quality leather and well crafted the sheath does not fit the knife at all and is just way to big allowing the knife to continually fall or pop out. It bounces around in the sheath and can just pop out if you are on a run or climb so I will have to do some modification to the sheath to get it to stay in the sheath. Very poor job on the fit of this sheath and certain;y a problem with quality control. Whoever passed that through should be fired.'

B003D9RBMU|28587302333038|"'5.0,Mine wasn\t super sharp out of the box but it didn\t take much to make it shaving sharp. I laquered the handle a couple of times and it goes backpacking,hiking,bushcrafting,and camping with me. Blades thicker than a Mora and full tang. Not a chopper but you can baton the living piss out of it and it looks no worse for wear.  Sheath is\"\"AWESOME\"\",if you like leather, which I do. German designed blade made in El Salvador. I couldn\\\\t recommend this enough for the money, great bushcrafting knife. Try one!'"
B003D9RBMU|2199023262956|'5.0,I picked this knife up after watching a video of a guy building a fire with it. Basically he used this knife and a piece of shoe string, check it out if you have a couple minutes.I had never heard of Condor, but really they deserve more recognition. And there\s actually a little bit of history behind the company. For around 20 dollars this knife is a steal. Great durability, awesome sheath, unique blade grind. The sharpness out of the box isn\t top notch, but for the duties that a bushcraft knife does, you should be prepared to sharpen it often anyways.Going back to the sheath, I\m going to say it\s worth 20 dollars by itself. It\s nothing fancy but just a nice quality that you don\t often see. The leather smells great too, even with age. The blade looks great too, mine had a blued swirl finish which hasn\t worn off yet. The handle is simple but sturdy.If I had to give 1 con it would be that the knife slightly resembles a steak knife, but that doesn\t bother me.'

The grips are very comfortable and fit well into everyone\s hands that have looked at it. The Sapien has a versatile blade design that allows for many uses. Hope that more people will give the Sapien a try as they will not be disappointed. Really like the knife and think Condor T&K has some very good products at more than reasonable costs.'

B003D9RBMU|26388279075880|'1.0,First of all let me say that I love Condor products. I own a few of their knives, an axe and a machete. For the price they can\t be beat. They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'

B003D9RBMU|13194139539264|'1.0,First of all let me say that I love Condor products. I own a few of their knives, an axe and a machete. For the price they can\t be beat. They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'

B003D9RBMU|30786325582438|'5.0,I picked this knife up after watching a video of a guy building a fire with it. Basically he used this knife and a piece of shoe string, check it out if you have a couple minutes.I had never heard of Condor, but really they deserve more recognition. And there\s actually a little bit of history behind the company. For around 20 dollars this knife is a steal. Great durability, awesome sheath, unique blade grind. The sharpness out of the box isn\t top notch, but for the duties that a bushcraft knife does, you should be prepared to sharpen it often anyways.Going back to the sheath, I\m going to say it\s worth 20 dollars by itself. It\s nothing fancy but just a nice quality that you don\t often see. The leather smells great too, even with age. The blade looks great too, mine had a blued swirl finish which hasn\t worn off yet.

The grips are very comfortable and fit well into everyone\s hands that have looked at it. The Sapien has a versatile blade design that allows for many uses.

B003D9RBMU|2199023262454|'4.0,This knife is better than I was expecting being so cheap in comparison with similar knives.  There is noticeable machining marks on the wood but I have been pretty rough with it anyways so its not a big concern.  The factory sharpening was lacking, be prepared to give it a quick once over right away, but once sharp, it holds its edge for quite some time due to the grind.  I would recommend keeping the knife lightly oiled when not in use because 1075 high carbon steel is not rust resistant, however, it throws a nice shower of sparks off my ferro rod where. The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'

B003D9RBMU|10995116284436|'4.0,This knife is better than I was expecting being so cheap in comparison with similar knives.  There is noticeable machining marks on the wood but I have been pretty rough with it anyways so its not a big concern.  The factory sharpening was lacking, be prepared to give it a quick once over right away, but once sharp, it holds its edge for quite some time due to the grind.  I would recommend keeping the knife lightly oiled when not in use because 1075 high carbon steel is not rust resistant, however, it throws a nice shower of sparks off my ferro rod where. The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'

The grips are very comfortable and fit well into everyone\s hands that have looked at it. The Sapien has a versatile blade design that allows for many uses. Hope that more people will give the Sapien a try as they will not be disappointed. Really like the knife and think Condor T&K has some very good products at more than reasonable costs.'

Otherwise, this is a great camp knife for all your utility purposes. Does very well at feather sticks and some fine carving. Certainly not meant for firewood processing but all in all a very useful addition to my kit. I do carry a number of knives for different purposes and as spares when weight is not an issue.The knife came awesomely sharp out of the box.and put to use immediately. I have not had the chance to put it though more vigorous testing but will add to this review when I am able.Meantime, I do recommend this knife as a good knife for light duty camp chores.UPDATE:After using this knife which is excellent and has performed flawlessly for a while now I have to add a negative point regarding the very well made but much to big sheath. While being made of excellent quality leather and well crafted the sheath does not fit the knife at all and is just way to big allowing the knife to continually fall or pop out. It bounces around in the sheath and can just pop out if you are on a run or climb so I will have to do some modification to the sheath to get it to stay in the sheath. Very poor job on the fit of this sheath and certain;y a problem with quality control. Whoever passed that through should be fired.'

The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'

B003D9RBMU|4398046520082|'4.0,This knife is better than I was expecting being so cheap in comparison with similar knives.  There is noticeable machining marks on the wood but I have been pretty rough with it anyways so its not a big concern.  The factory sharpening was lacking, be prepared to give it a quick once over right away, but once sharp, it holds its edge for quite some time due to the grind.  I would recommend keeping the knife lightly oiled when not in use because 1075 high carbon steel is not rust resistant, however, it throws a nice shower of sparks off my ferro rod where. The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'
B003D9RBMU|8796093022610|'5.0,I picked this knife up after watching a video of a guy building a fire with it. Basically he used this knife and a piece of shoe string, check it out if you have a couple minutes.I had never heard of Condor, but really they deserve more recognition. And there\s actually a little bit of history behind the company. For around 20 dollars this knife is a steal. Great durability, awesome sheath, unique blade grind. The sharpness out of the box isn\t top notch, but for the duties that a bushcraft knife does, you should be prepared to sharpen it often anyways.Going back to the sheath, I\m going to say it\s worth 20 dollars by itself. It\s nothing fancy but just a nice quality that you don\t often see. The leather smells great too, even with age. The blade looks great too, mine had a blued swirl finish which hasn\t worn off yet. The handle is simple but sturdy.If I had to give 1 con it would be that the knife slightly resembles a steak knife, but that doesn\t bother me.'

B003D9RBMU|15393162790188|'4.0,I havent used it yet , but , it seems like the other Condor knives I own. The steel is good , the grind is slightly uneven. The handle is smooth and well shaped. The sheath , as always , is top notch and worth the price of the knife. I may buy another one of these , just to use the sheath for a Mora. The knife is in fact similar to a Mora. But , I think with the width being more narrow , I should get a better cut for carving. I will update as soon as I have a chance to compare the two.'

B003D9RBMU|21990232558337|'5.0,I picked this knife up after watching a video of a guy building a fire with it. Basically he used this knife and a piece of shoe string, check it out if you have a couple minutes.I had never heard of Condor, but really they deserve more recognition. And there\s actually a little bit of history behind the company. For around 20 dollars this knife is a steal. Great durability, awesome sheath, unique blade grind. The sharpness out of the box isn\t top notch, but for the duties that a bushcraft knife does, you should be prepared to sharpen it often anyways.Going back to the sheath, I\m going to say it\s worth 20 dollars by itself. It\s nothing fancy but just a nice quality that you don\t often see. The leather smells great too, even with age. The blade looks great too, mine had a blued swirl finish which hasn\t worn off yet. The handle is simple but sturdy.If I had to give 1 con it would be that the knife slightly resembles a steak knife, but that doesn\t bother me.'
B003D9RBMU|24189255811490|'5.0,EXCELLENT quality knife!!If you are looking for a good SMALL knife for an everyday carry style knife and for fine work tasks this is a wonderful knife...the fit and finish on this knife are fantastic and it comes out of the box razor sharp....the size is small and reminds me of a VERY stout and robust steak knife or paring knife....but it feels GREAT in the hand and is an excellent quality knife....This being said, i gave this to my wife and will definitely borrow it for the fine carving tasks i might need in camp....but for MY everyday carry i went with the Condor Bushlore Knife in the 4 inch blade....'
B003D9RBMU|30786325587360|'5.0,Man....I can\\t believe this only cost $25 bucks. The handle was flush, I cut myself taking it out of the wrapper. Condor must have a stock of dead cows because their sheath is more than thick enough to hold the knife. I\\m still speechless, after a few months of use, I can\\t begin to wrap my head around the other knives this size that I\\ve paid for. I\\ve used this at a few outdoor skills classes too, and everyone wants to borrow it.  Sharp edge, flush handle, custom looking craftsmanship.A+'
B003D9RBMU|32985348837678|'4.0,Putting aside the funky name, this knife is a solid value.  Fits well in hand just keep the blade oiled and this should last forever providing service with a smile.  What more can you ask for. Condor is really providing cost performance value in their knives. The fit, function and finish is spot on. No problems go ahead and get it.'
B003D9RBMU|4820|'5.0,I wanted a full tang Mora and that\s what this is. It\s slightly thicker than the Mora Heavy Duty but basically the same profile and grind. Great knife. Very dependable. I\m probably going to get a custom kydex sheath for it in the cold steel style of sheaths. Love those Cold Steel sheaths!'
B003D9RBMU|4398046512205|'4.0,i bought this knife because i\m a big fan of condor products. the knife itself is knife despite coming dull. the handles are a nice red color and with a little bit of linseed oil they look great. the sheath is nice thick leather, a bit unsightly, but still functional. unfortunately, the retention is horrible. there is about a half an inch of extra space left un-sewn making the sheath\s grip on the knife almost unnoticeable. i sewed this closed to add retention and now it\s a decent package.'

The grips are very comfortable and fit well into everyone\s hands that have looked at it. The Sapien has a versatile blade design that allows for many uses. Hope that more people will give the Sapien a try as they will not be disappointed. Really like the knife and think Condor T&K has some very good products at more than reasonable costs.'

B003D9RBMU|19791209308534|'1.0,First of all let me say that I love Condor products. I own a few of their knives, an axe and a machete. For the price they can\t be beat. They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'

While being made of excellent quality leather and well crafted the sheath does not fit the knife at all and is just way to big allowing the knife to continually fall or pop out. It bounces around in the sheath and can just pop out if you are on a run or climb so I will have to do some modification to the sheath to get it to stay in the sheath.

B003D9RBMU|26388279076924|'4.0,This knife is better than I was expecting being so cheap in comparison with similar knives.  There is noticeable machining marks on the wood but I have been pretty rough with it anyways so its not a big concern.  The factory sharpening was lacking, be prepared to give it a quick once over right away, but once sharp, it holds its edge for quite some time due to the grind.  I would recommend keeping the knife lightly oiled when not in use because 1075 high carbon steel is not rust resistant, however, it throws a nice shower of sparks off my ferro rod where. The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'

B003D9RBMU|15393162792931|'4.0,i bought this knife because i\m a big fan of condor products. the knife itself is knife despite coming dull. the handles are a nice red color and with a little bit of linseed oil they look great. the sheath is nice thick leather, a bit unsightly, but still functional. unfortunately, the retention is horrible. there is about a half an inch of extra space left un-sewn making the sheath\s grip on the knife almost unnoticeable. i sewed this closed to add retention and now it\s a decent package.'

The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'
B003D9RBMU|2199023258076|'5.0,I love this little knife. The only thing I would change is a better grip or way your hand won\t slide onto the blade under certain conditions. Otherwise, this is a great camp knife for all your utility purposes. Does very well at feather sticks and some fine carving. Certainly not meant for firewood processing but all in all a very useful addition to my kit. I do carry a number of knives for different purposes and as spares when weight is not an issue.The knife came awesomely sharp out of the box.and put to use immediately. I have not had the chance to put it though more vigorous testing but will add to this review when I am able.Meantime, I do recommend this knife as a good knife for light duty camp chores.UPDATE:After using this knife which is excellent and has performed flawlessly for a while now I have to add a negative point regarding the very well made but much to big sheath. While being made of excellent quality leather and well crafted the sheath does not fit the knife at all and is just way to big allowing the knife to continually fall or pop out. It bounces around in the sheath and can just pop out if you are on a run or climb so I will have to do some modification to the sheath to get it to stay in the sheath. Very poor job on the fit of this sheath and certain;y a problem with quality control. Whoever passed that through should be fired.'
B003D9RBMU|4398046519583|'4.0,I havent used it yet , but , it seems like the other Condor knives I own. The steel is good , the grind is slightly uneven. The handle is smooth and well shaped. The sheath , as always , is top notch and worth the price of the knife. I may buy another one of these , just to use the sheath for a Mora. The knife is in fact similar to a Mora. But , I think with the width being more narrow , I should get a better cut for carving. I will update as soon as I have a chance to compare the two.'

B003D9RBMU|13194139539177|'4.0,This knife is better than I was expecting being so cheap in comparison with similar knives.  There is noticeable machining marks on the wood but I have been pretty rough with it anyways so its not a big concern.  The factory sharpening was lacking, be prepared to give it a quick once over right away, but once sharp, it holds its edge for quite some time due to the grind.  I would recommend keeping the knife lightly oiled when not in use because 1075 high carbon steel is not rust resistant, however, it throws a nice shower of sparks off my ferro rod where. The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'

B003D9RBMU|17592186051928|'5.0,I love this little knife. The only thing I would change is a better grip or way your hand won\t slide onto the blade under certain conditions. Otherwise, this is a great camp knife for all your utility purposes. Does very well at feather sticks and some fine carving. Certainly not meant for firewood processing but all in all a very useful addition to my kit. I do carry a number of knives for different purposes and as spares when weight is not an issue.The knife came awesomely sharp out of the box.and put to use immediately. I have not had the chance to put it though more vigorous testing but will add to this review when I am able.Meantime, I do recommend this knife as a good knife for light duty camp chores.UPDATE:After using this knife which is excellent and has performed flawlessly for a while now I have to add a negative point regarding the very well made but much to big sheath. While being made of excellent quality leather and well crafted the sheath does not fit the knife at all and is just way to big allowing the knife to continually fall or pop out. It bounces around in the sheath and can just pop out if you are on a run or climb so I will have to do some modification to the sheath to get it to stay in the sheath. Very poor job on the fit of this sheath and certain;y a problem with quality control. Whoever passed that through should be fired.'

B003D9RBMU|4398046520123|'5.0,I wanted a full tang Mora and that\s what this is. It\s slightly thicker than the Mora Heavy Duty but basically the same profile and grind. Great knife. Very dependable.

B003D9RBMU|2199023258501|'1.0,First of all let me say that I love Condor products. I own a few of their knives, an axe and a machete. For the price they can\t be beat. They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'

I would recommend keeping the knife lightly oiled when not in use because 1075 high carbon steel is not rust resistant, however, it throws a nice shower of sparks off my ferro rod where. The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'

B003D9RBMU|32985348833930|'5.0,I picked this knife up after watching a video of a guy building a fire with it. Basically he used this knife and a piece of shoe string, check it out if you have a couple minutes.I had never heard of Condor, but really they deserve more recognition. And there\s actually a little bit of history behind the company. For around 20 dollars this knife is a steal. Great durability, awesome sheath, unique blade grind. The sharpness out of the box isn\t top notch, but for the duties that a bushcraft knife does, you should be prepared to sharpen it often anyways.Going back to the sheath, I\m going to say it\s worth 20 dollars by itself. It\s nothing fancy but just a nice quality that you don\t often see. The leather smells great too, even with age. The blade looks great too, mine had a blued swirl finish which hasn\t worn off yet. The handle is simple but sturdy.If I had to give 1 con it would be that the knife slightly resembles a steak knife, but that doesn\t bother me.'

B003D9RBMU|17592186045136|'5.0,I\m not sure why the Sapien isn\t more popular as it seems to not get mentioned very often, which is a shame as this is a handy little knife. The grips are very comfortable and fit well into everyone\s hands that have looked at it. The Sapien has a versatile blade design that allows for many uses. Hope that more people will give the Sapien a try as they will not be disappointed. Really like the knife and think Condor T&K has some very good products at more than reasonable costs.'

B003D9RBMU|28587302330374|'5.0,EXCELLENT quality knife!!If you are looking for a good SMALL knife for an everyday carry style knife and for fine work tasks this is a wonderful knife...the fit and finish on this knife are fantastic and it comes out of the box razor sharp....the size is small and reminds me of a VERY stout and robust steak knife or paring knife....but it feels GREAT in the hand and is an excellent quality knife....This being said, i gave this to my wife and will definitely borrow it for the fine carving tasks i might need in camp....but for MY everyday carry i went with the Condor Bushlore Knife in the 4 inch blade....'
B003D9RBMU|28587302331633|'1.0,First of all let me say that I love Condor products. I own a few of their knives, an axe and a machete. For the price they can\t be beat. They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'

The grips are very comfortable and fit well into everyone\s hands that have looked at it. The Sapien has a versatile blade design that allows for many uses.

B003D9RBMU|10995116287477|'4.0,i bought this knife because i\m a big fan of condor products. the knife itself is knife despite coming dull. the handles are a nice red color and with a little bit of linseed oil they look great. the sheath is nice thick leather, a bit unsightly, but still functional. unfortunately, the retention is horrible. there is about a half an inch of extra space left un-sewn making the sheath\s grip on the knife almost unnoticeable. i sewed this closed to add retention and now it\s a decent package.'
B003D9RBMU|13194139541353|'5.0,I picked this knife up after watching a video of a guy building a fire with it.

The sharpness out of the box isn\t top notch, but for the duties that a bushcraft knife does, you should be prepared to sharpen it often anyways.Going back to the sheath, I\m going to say it\s worth 20 dollars by itself. It\s nothing fancy but just a nice quality that you don\t often see. The leather smells great too, even with age. The blade looks great too, mine had a blued swirl finish which hasn\t worn off yet. The handle is simple but sturdy.If I had to give 1 con it would be that the knife slightly resembles a steak knife, but that doesn\t bother me.'

I laquered the handle a couple of times and it goes backpacking,hiking,bushcrafting,and camping with me. Blades thicker than a Mora and full tang. Not a chopper but you can baton the living piss out of it and it looks no worse for wear.  Sheath is\"\"AWESOME\"\",if you like leather, which I do. German designed blade made in El Salvador. I couldn\\\\t recommend this enough for the money, great bushcrafting knife. Try one!'"
B003D9RBMU|21990232556235|'5.0,I wanted a full tang Mora and that\s what this is. It\s slightly thicker than the Mora Heavy Duty but basically the same profile and grind. Great knife.

B003D9RBMU|28587302332248|'4.0,This knife is better than I was expecting being so cheap in comparison with similar knives.  There is noticeable machining marks on the wood but I have been pretty rough with it anyways so its not a big concern.  The factory sharpening was lacking, be prepared to give it a quick once over right away, but once sharp, it holds its edge for quite some time due to the grind.  I would recommend keeping the knife lightly oiled when not in use because 1075 high carbon steel is not rust resistant, however, it throws a nice shower of sparks off my ferro rod where. The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'
B003D9RBMU|1966|'4.0,I havent used it yet , but , it seems like the other Condor knives I own. The steel is good , the grind is slightly uneven. The handle is smooth and well shaped. The sheath , as always , is top notch and worth the price of the knife. I may buy another one of these , just to use the sheath for a Mora. The knife is in fact similar to a Mora. But , I think with the width being more narrow , I should get a better cut for carving. I will update as soon as I have a chance to compare the two.'

B003D9RBMU|21990232557120|'5.0,Man....I can\\t believe this only cost $25 bucks. The handle was flush, I cut myself taking it out of the wrapper. Condor must have a stock of dead cows because their sheath is more than thick enough to hold the knife. I\\m still speechless, after a few months of use, I can\\t begin to wrap my head around the other knives this size that I\\ve paid for. I\\ve used this at a few outdoor skills classes too, and everyone wants to borrow it.  Sharp edge, flush handle, custom looking craftsmanship.A+'
B003D9RBMU|24189255814908|'5.0,I wanted a full tang Mora and that\s what this is. It\s slightly thicker than the Mora Heavy Duty but basically the same profile and grind. Great knife. Very dependable. I\m probably going to get a custom kydex sheath for it in the cold steel style of sheaths. Love those Cold Steel sheaths!'

B003D9RBMU|2199023259568|'4.0,I havent used it yet , but , it seems like the other Condor knives I own. The steel is good , the grind is slightly uneven. The handle is smooth and well shaped. The sheath , as always , is top notch and worth the price of the knife. I may buy another one of these , just to use the sheath for a Mora. The knife is in fact similar to a Mora. But , I think with the width being more narrow , I should get a better cut for carving. I will update as soon as I have a chance to compare the two.'

B003D9RBMU|15393162795911|'1.0,First of all let me say that I love Condor products. I own a few of their knives, an axe and a machete. For the price they can\t be beat. They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'

B003D9RBMU|28587302329113|'5.0,I love this little knife. The only thing I would change is a better grip or way your hand won\t slide onto the blade under certain conditions. Otherwise, this is a great camp knife for all your utility purposes. Does very well at feather sticks and some fine carving. Certainly not meant for firewood processing but all in all a very useful addition to my kit. I do carry a number of knives for different purposes and as spares when weight is not an issue.The knife came awesomely sharp out of the box.and put to use immediately. I have not had the chance to put it though more vigorous testing but will add to this review when I am able.Meantime, I do recommend this knife as a good knife for light duty camp chores.UPDATE:After using this knife which is excellent and has performed flawlessly for a while now I have to add a negative point regarding the very well made but much to big sheath. While being made of excellent quality leather and well crafted the sheath does not fit the knife at all and is just way to big allowing the knife to continually fall or pop out. It bounces around in the sheath and can just pop out if you are on a run or climb so I will have to do some modification to the sheath to get it to stay in the sheath. Very poor job on the fit of this sheath and certain;y a problem with quality control. Whoever passed that through should be fired.'

B003D9RBMU|15393162798066|'4.0,This knife is better than I was expecting being so cheap in comparison with similar knives.  There is noticeable machining marks on the wood but I have been pretty rough with it anyways so its not a big concern.  The factory sharpening was lacking, be prepared to give it a quick once over right away, but once sharp, it holds its edge for quite some time due to the grind.  I would recommend keeping the knife lightly oiled when not in use because 1075 high carbon steel is not rust resistant, however, it throws a nice shower of sparks off my ferro rod where. The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'

B003D9RBMU|28587302332015|'5.0,I\m not sure why the Sapien isn\t more popular as it seems to not get mentioned very often, which is a shame as this is a handy little knife. The grips are very comfortable and fit well into everyone\s hands that have looked at it. The Sapien has a versatile blade design that allows for many uses. Hope that more people will give the Sapien a try as they will not be disappointed. Really like the knife and think Condor T&K has some very good products at more than reasonable costs.'

B003D9RBMU|17592186045134|'1.0,First of all let me say that I love Condor products. I own a few of their knives, an axe and a machete. For the price they can\t be beat. They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'

B003D9RBMU|28587302326660|'4.0,i bought this knife because i\m a big fan of condor products. the knife itself is knife despite coming dull. the handles are a nice red color and with a little bit of linseed oil they look great. the sheath is nice thick leather, a bit unsightly, but still functional. unfortunately, the retention is horrible. there is about a half an inch of extra space left un-sewn making the sheath\s grip on the knife almost unnoticeable. i sewed this closed to add retention and now it\s a decent package.'
B003D9RBMU|8796093024842|'5.0,I\m not sure why the Sapien isn\t more popular as it seems to not get mentioned very often, which is a shame as this is a handy little knife. The grips are very comfortable and fit well into everyone\s hands that have looked at it. The Sapien has a versatile blade design that allows for many uses. Hope that more people will give the Sapien a try as they will not be disappointed. Really like the knife and think Condor T&K has some very good products at more than reasonable costs.'
B003D9RBMU|8796093028018|'5.0,I love this little knife. The only thing I would change is a better grip or way your hand won\t slide onto the blade under certain conditions. Otherwise, this is a great camp knife for all your utility purposes. Does very well at feather sticks and some fine carving. Certainly not meant for firewood processing but all in all a very useful addition to my kit. I do carry a number of knives for different purposes and as spares when weight is not an issue.The knife came awesomely sharp out of the box.and put to use immediately. I have not had the chance to put it though more vigorous testing but will add to this review when I am able.Meantime, I do recommend this knife as a good knife for light duty camp chores.UPDATE:After using this knife which is excellent and has performed flawlessly for a while now I have to add a negative point regarding the very well made but much to big sheath. While being made of excellent quality leather and well crafted the sheath does not fit the knife at all and is just way to big allowing the knife to continually fall or pop out. It bounces around in the sheath and can just pop out if you are on a run or climb so I will have to do some modification to the sheath to get it to stay in the sheath. Very poor job on the fit of this sheath and certain;y a problem with quality control. Whoever passed that through should be fired.'

B003D9RBMU|13194139534018|'4.0,This knife is better than I was expecting being so cheap in comparison with similar knives.  There is noticeable machining marks on the wood but I have been pretty rough with it anyways so its not a big concern.  The factory sharpening was lacking, be prepared to give it a quick once over right away, but once sharp, it holds its edge for quite some time due to the grind.  I would recommend keeping the knife lightly oiled when not in use because 1075 high carbon steel is not rust resistant, however, it throws a nice shower of sparks off my ferro rod where. The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'
B003D9RBMU|15393162794724|'5.0,EXCELLENT quality knife!!If you are looking for a good SMALL knife for an everyday carry style knife and for fine work tasks this is a wonderful knife...the fit and finish on this knife are fantastic and it comes out of the box razor sharp....the size is small and reminds me of a VERY stout and robust steak knife or paring knife....but it feels GREAT in the hand and is an excellent quality knife....This being said, i gave this to my wife and will definitely borrow it for the fine carving tasks i might need in camp....but for MY everyday carry i went with the Condor Bushlore Knife in the 4 inch blade....'
B003D9RBMU|15393162798010|'5.0,I wanted a full tang Mora and that\s what this is. It\s slightly thicker than the Mora Heavy Duty but basically the same profile and grind. Great knife.

B003D9RBMU|26388279077172|'1.0,First of all let me say that I love Condor products. I own a few of their knives, an axe and a machete. For the price they can\t be beat. They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'

B003D9RBMU|6004|'5.0,I wanted a full tang Mora and that\s what this is. It\s slightly thicker than the Mora Heavy Duty but basically the same profile and grind. Great knife. Very dependable.

B003D9RBMU|4398046517409|'5.0,I love this little knife. The only thing I would change is a better grip or way your hand won\t slide onto the blade under certain conditions. Otherwise, this is a great camp knife for all your utility purposes. Does very well at feather sticks and some fine carving. Certainly not meant for firewood processing but all in all a very useful addition to my kit. I do carry a number of knives for different purposes and as spares when weight is not an issue.The knife came awesomely sharp out of the box.and put to use immediately. I have not had the chance to put it though more vigorous testing but will add to this review when I am able.Meantime, I do recommend this knife as a good knife for light duty camp chores.UPDATE:After using this knife which is excellent and has performed flawlessly for a while now I have to add a negative point regarding the very well made but much to big sheath. While being made of excellent quality leather and well crafted the sheath does not fit the knife at all and is just way to big allowing the knife to continually fall or pop out. It bounces around in the sheath and can just pop out if you are on a run or climb so I will have to do some modification to the sheath to get it to stay in the sheath. Very poor job on the fit of this sheath and certain;y a problem with quality control. Whoever passed that through should be fired.'

B003D9RBMU|381|'1.0,First of all let me say that I love Condor products. I own a few of their knives, an axe and a machete. For the price they can\t be beat. They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'

B003D9RBMU|19791209309066|'4.0,This knife is better than I was expecting being so cheap in comparison with similar knives.  There is noticeable machining marks on the wood but I have been pretty rough with it anyways so its not a big concern.  The factory sharpening was lacking, be prepared to give it a quick once over right away, but once sharp, it holds its edge for quite some time due to the grind.  I would recommend keeping the knife lightly oiled when not in use because 1075 high carbon steel is not rust resistant, however, it throws a nice shower of sparks off my ferro rod where. The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'

B003D9RBMU|21990232564031|'5.0,I picked this knife up after watching a video of a guy building a fire with it. Basically he used this knife and a piece of shoe string, check it out if you have a couple minutes.I had never heard of Condor, but really they deserve more recognition. And there\s actually a little bit of history behind the company. For around 20 dollars this knife is a steal. Great durability, awesome sheath, unique blade grind. The sharpness out of the box isn\t top notch, but for the duties that a bushcraft knife does, you should be prepared to sharpen it often anyways.Going back to the sheath, I\m going to say it\s worth 20 dollars by itself. It\s nothing fancy but just a nice quality that you don\t often see. The leather smells great too, even with age. The blade looks great too, mine had a blued swirl finish which hasn\t worn off yet. The handle is simple but sturdy.If I had to give 1 con it would be that the knife slightly resembles a steak knife, but that doesn\t bother me.'

The sheath , as always , is top notch and worth the price of the knife. I may buy another one of these , just to use the sheath for a Mora. The knife is in fact similar to a Mora. But , I think with the width being more narrow , I should get a better cut for carving. I will update as soon as I have a chance to compare the two.'

Otherwise, this is a great camp knife for all your utility purposes. Does very well at feather sticks and some fine carving. Certainly not meant for firewood processing but all in all a very useful addition to my kit. I do carry a number of knives for different purposes and as spares when weight is not an issue.The knife came awesomely sharp out of the box.and put to use immediately. I have not had the chance to put it though more vigorous testing but will add to this review when I am able.Meantime, I do recommend this knife as a good knife for light duty camp chores.UPDATE:After using this knife which is excellent and has performed flawlessly for a while now I have to add a negative point regarding the very well made but much to big sheath. While being made of excellent quality leather and well crafted the sheath does not fit the knife at all and is just way to big allowing the knife to continually fall or pop out. It bounces around in the sheath and can just pop out if you are on a run or climb so I will have to do some modification to the sheath to get it to stay in the sheath. Very poor job on the fit of this sheath and certain;y a problem with quality control. Whoever passed that through should be fired.'

The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length.

B003D9RBMU|5436|'5.0,I picked this knife up after watching a video of a guy building a fire with it. Basically he used this knife and a piece of shoe string, check it out if you have a couple minutes.I had never heard of Condor, but really they deserve more recognition. And there\s actually a little bit of history behind the company. For around 20 dollars this knife is a steal. Great durability, awesome sheath, unique blade grind. The sharpness out of the box isn\t top notch, but for the duties that a bushcraft knife does, you should be prepared to sharpen it often anyways.Going back to the sheath, I\m going to say it\s worth 20 dollars by itself. It\s nothing fancy but just a nice quality that you don\t often see. The leather smells great too, even with age. The blade looks great too, mine had a blued swirl finish which hasn\t worn off yet. The handle is simple but sturdy.If I had to give 1 con it would be that the knife slightly resembles a steak knife, but that doesn\t bother me.'

B003D9RBMU|2836|'1.0,First of all let me say that I love Condor products. I own a few of their knives, an axe and a machete. For the price they can\t be beat. They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'

The sheath , as always , is top notch and worth the price of the knife. I may buy another one of these , just to use the sheath for a Mora. The knife is in fact similar to a Mora.

While being made of excellent quality leather and well crafted the sheath does not fit the knife at all and is just way to big allowing the knife to continually fall or pop out. It bounces around in the sheath and can just pop out if you are on a run or climb so I will have to do some modification to the sheath to get it to stay in the sheath. Very poor job on the fit of this sheath and certain;y a problem with quality control. Whoever passed that through should be fired.'

The grips are very comfortable and fit well into everyone\s hands that have looked at it. The Sapien has a versatile blade design that allows for many uses. Hope that more people will give the Sapien a try as they will not be disappointed. Really like the knife and think Condor T&K has some very good products at more than reasonable costs.'

While being made of excellent quality leather and well crafted the sheath does not fit the knife at all and is just way to big allowing the knife to continually fall or pop out. It bounces around in the sheath and can just pop out if you are on a run or climb so I will have to do some modification to the sheath to get it to stay in the sheath.

B003D9RBMU|4398046512707|'5.0,I picked this knife up after watching a video of a guy building a fire with it. Basically he used this knife and a piece of shoe string, check it out if you have a couple minutes.I had never heard of Condor, but really they deserve more recognition. And there\s actually a little bit of history behind the company. For around 20 dollars this knife is a steal. Great durability, awesome sheath, unique blade grind. The sharpness out of the box isn\t top notch, but for the duties that a bushcraft knife does, you should be prepared to sharpen it often anyways.Going back to the sheath, I\m going to say it\s worth 20 dollars by itself. It\s nothing fancy but just a nice quality that you don\t often see. The leather smells great too, even with age. The blade looks great too, mine had a blued swirl finish which hasn\t worn off yet. The handle is simple but sturdy.If I had to give 1 con it would be that the knife slightly resembles a steak knife, but that doesn\t bother me.'
B003D9RBMU|6597069774662|'4.0,I havent used it yet , but , it seems like the other Condor knives I own. The steel is good , the grind is slightly uneven. The handle is smooth and well shaped. The sheath , as always , is top notch and worth the price of the knife. I may buy another one of these , just to use the sheath for a Mora. The knife is in fact similar to a Mora.

The grips are very comfortable and fit well into everyone\s hands that have looked at it. The Sapien has a versatile blade design that allows for many uses.

B003D9RBMU|28587302322202|'1.0,First of all let me say that I love Condor products. I own a few of their knives, an axe and a machete. For the price they can\t be beat. They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'

There is noticeable machining marks on the wood but I have been pretty rough with it anyways so its not a big concern.  The factory sharpening was lacking, be prepared to give it a quick once over right away, but once sharp, it holds its edge for quite some time due to the grind.  I would recommend keeping the knife lightly oiled when not in use because 1075 high carbon steel is not rust resistant, however, it throws a nice shower of sparks off my ferro rod where. The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'

Very poor job on the fit of this sheath and certain;y a problem with quality control. Whoever passed that through should be fired.'

The sheath , as always , is top notch and worth the price of the knife. I may buy another one of these , just to use the sheath for a Mora. The knife is in fact similar to a Mora. But , I think with the width being more narrow , I should get a better cut for carving. I will update as soon as I have a chance to compare the two.'

The grips are very comfortable and fit well into everyone\s hands that have looked at it. The Sapien has a versatile blade design that allows for many uses. Hope that more people will give the Sapien a try as they will not be disappointed. Really like the knife and think Condor T&K has some very good products at more than reasonable costs.'

They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'

The factory sharpening was lacking, be prepared to give it a quick once over right away, but once sharp, it holds its edge for quite some time due to the grind.  I would recommend keeping the knife lightly oiled when not in use because 1075 high carbon steel is not rust resistant, however, it throws a nice shower of sparks off my ferro rod where. The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'

Basically he used this knife and a piece of shoe string, check it out if you have a couple minutes.I had never heard of Condor, but really they deserve more recognition. And there\s actually a little bit of history behind the company. For around 20 dollars this knife is a steal. Great durability, awesome sheath, unique blade grind. The sharpness out of the box isn\t top notch, but for the duties that a bushcraft knife does, you should be prepared to sharpen it often anyways.Going back to the sheath, I\m going to say it\s worth 20 dollars by itself. It\s nothing fancy but just a nice quality that you don\t often see. The leather smells great too, even with age. The blade looks great too, mine had a blued swirl finish which hasn\t worn off yet. The handle is simple but sturdy.If I had to give 1 con it would be that the knife slightly resembles a steak knife, but that doesn\t bother me.'

B003D9RBMU|17592186046119|'5.0,I love this little knife. The only thing I would change is a better grip or way your hand won\t slide onto the blade under certain conditions. Otherwise, this is a great camp knife for all your utility purposes. Does very well at feather sticks and some fine carving. Certainly not meant for firewood processing but all in all a very useful addition to my kit. I do carry a number of knives for different purposes and as spares when weight is not an issue.The knife came awesomely sharp out of the box.and put to use immediately. I have not had the chance to put it though more vigorous testing but will add to this review when I am able.Meantime, I do recommend this knife as a good knife for light duty camp chores.UPDATE:After using this knife which is excellent and has performed flawlessly for a while now I have to add a negative point regarding the very well made but much to big sheath. While being made of excellent quality leather and well crafted the sheath does not fit the knife at all and is just way to big allowing the knife to continually fall or pop out. It bounces around in the sheath and can just pop out if you are on a run or climb so I will have to do some modification to the sheath to get it to stay in the sheath.

Hope that more people will give the Sapien a try as they will not be disappointed. Really like the knife and think Condor T&K has some very good products at more than reasonable costs.'
B003D9RBMU|6597069767257|'4.0,This knife is better than I was expecting being so cheap in comparison with similar knives.  There is noticeable machining marks on the wood but I have been pretty rough with it anyways so its not a big concern.  The factory sharpening was lacking, be prepared to give it a quick once over right away, but once sharp, it holds its edge for quite some time due to the grind.  I would recommend keeping the knife lightly oiled when not in use because 1075 high carbon steel is not rust resistant, however, it throws a nice shower of sparks off my ferro rod where. The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'

B003D9RBMU|24189255812542|'5.0,I wanted a full tang Mora and that\s what this is. It\s slightly thicker than the Mora Heavy Duty but basically the same profile and grind. Great knife.

B003D9RBMU|26388279076928|'1.0,First of all let me say that I love Condor products. I own a few of their knives, an axe and a machete. For the price they can\t be beat. They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'

And there\s actually a little bit of history behind the company. For around 20 dollars this knife is a steal. Great durability, awesome sheath, unique blade grind. The sharpness out of the box isn\t top notch, but for the duties that a bushcraft knife does, you should be prepared to sharpen it often anyways.Going back to the sheath, I\m going to say it\s worth 20 dollars by itself. It\s nothing fancy but just a nice quality that you don\t often see. The leather smells great too, even with age. The blade looks great too, mine had a blued swirl finish which hasn\t worn off yet. The handle is simple but sturdy.If I had to give 1 con it would be that the knife slightly resembles a steak knife, but that doesn\t bother me.'

The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'
B003D9RBMU|32985348833736|'1.0,First of all let me say that I love Condor products. I own a few of their knives, an axe and a machete. For the price they can\t be beat. They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'

B003D9RBMU|6597069774078|'5.0,I picked this knife up after watching a video of a guy building a fire with it. Basically he used this knife and a piece of shoe string, check it out if you have a couple minutes.I had never heard of Condor, but really they deserve more recognition. And there\s actually a little bit of history behind the company. For around 20 dollars this knife is a steal. Great durability, awesome sheath, unique blade grind. The sharpness out of the box isn\t top notch, but for the duties that a bushcraft knife does, you should be prepared to sharpen it often anyways.Going back to the sheath, I\m going to say it\s worth 20 dollars by itself. It\s nothing fancy but just a nice quality that you don\t often see. The leather smells great too, even with age. The blade looks great too, mine had a blued swirl finish which hasn\t worn off yet. The handle is simple but sturdy.If I had to give 1 con it would be that the knife slightly resembles a steak knife, but that doesn\t bother me.'
B003D9RBMU|10995116281623|'5.0,I love this little knife. The only thing I would change is a better grip or way your hand won\t slide onto the blade under certain conditions. Otherwise, this is a great camp knife for all your utility purposes. Does very well at feather sticks and some fine carving.

While being made of excellent quality leather and well crafted the sheath does not fit the knife at all and is just way to big allowing the knife to continually fall or pop out. It bounces around in the sheath and can just pop out if you are on a run or climb so I will have to do some modification to the sheath to get it to stay in the sheath. Very poor job on the fit of this sheath and certain;y a problem with quality control. Whoever passed that through should be fired.'

While being made of excellent quality leather and well crafted the sheath does not fit the knife at all and is just way to big allowing the knife to continually fall or pop out. It bounces around in the sheath and can just pop out if you are on a run or climb so I will have to do some modification to the sheath to get it to stay in the sheath. Very poor job on the fit of this sheath and certain;y a problem with quality control. Whoever passed that through should be fired.'
B003D9RBMU|13194139536810|'1.0,First of all let me say that I love Condor products. I own a few of their knives, an axe and a machete. For the price they can\t be beat. They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'
B003D9RBMU|17592186052346|'4.0,This knife is better than I was expecting being so cheap in comparison with similar knives.  There is noticeable machining marks on the wood but I have been pretty rough with it anyways so its not a big concern.  The factory sharpening was lacking, be prepared to give it a quick once over right away, but once sharp, it holds its edge for quite some time due to the grind.  I would recommend keeping the knife lightly oiled when not in use because 1075 high carbon steel is not rust resistant, however, it throws a nice shower of sparks off my ferro rod where. The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'
B003D9RBMU|19791209308084|'5.0,I wanted a full tang Mora and that\s what this is. It\s slightly thicker than the Mora Heavy Duty but basically the same profile and grind. Great knife.

B003D9RBMU|4398046521587|'4.0,i bought this knife because i\m a big fan of condor products. the knife itself is knife despite coming dull. the handles are a nice red color and with a little bit of linseed oil they look great. the sheath is nice thick leather, a bit unsightly, but still functional. unfortunately, the retention is horrible. there is about a half an inch of extra space left un-sewn making the sheath\s grip on the knife almost unnoticeable. i sewed this closed to add retention and now it\s a decent package.'
B003D9RBMU|15393162794029|'5.0,I\m not sure why the Sapien isn\t more popular as it seems to not get mentioned very often, which is a shame as this is a handy little knife. The grips are very comfortable and fit well into everyone\s hands that have looked at it. The Sapien has a versatile blade design that allows for many uses. Hope that more people will give the Sapien a try as they will not be disappointed. Really like the knife and think Condor T&K has some very good products at more than reasonable costs.'
B003D9RBMU|17592186045982|'4.0,I havent used it yet , but , it seems like the other Condor knives I own. The steel is good , the grind is slightly uneven. The handle is smooth and well shaped. The sheath , as always , is top notch and worth the price of the knife. I may buy another one of these , just to use the sheath for a Mora. The knife is in fact similar to a Mora. But , I think with the width being more narrow , I should get a better cut for carving. I will update as soon as I have a chance to compare the two.'

The BROWN leather sheath holds the knife nice and snug while showing nice craftsmanship and durability. I have used it for many camp tasks and it performs very nicely.'
B003D9RBMU|10995116278934|'4.0,i bought this knife because i\m a big fan of condor products. the knife itself is knife despite coming dull. the handles are a nice red color and with a little bit of linseed oil they look great. the sheath is nice thick leather, a bit unsightly, but still functional. unfortunately, the retention is horrible. there is about a half an inch of extra space left un-sewn making the sheath\s grip on the knife almost unnoticeable. i sewed this closed to add retention and now it\s a decent package.'
B003D9RBMU|10995116278959|'5.0,Man....I can\\t believe this only cost $25 bucks. The handle was flush, I cut myself taking it out of the wrapper. Condor must have a stock of dead cows because their sheath is more than thick enough to hold the knife. I\\m still speechless, after a few months of use, I can\\t begin to wrap my head around the other knives this size that I\\ve paid for. I\\ve used this at a few outdoor skills classes too, and everyone wants to borrow it.  Sharp edge, flush handle, custom looking craftsmanship.A+'
B003D9RBMU|13194139538139|'5.0,I picked this knife up after watching a video of a guy building a fire with it. Basically he used this knife and a piece of shoe string, check it out if you have a couple minutes.I had never heard of Condor, but really they deserve more recognition. And there\s actually a little bit of history behind the company. For around 20 dollars this knife is a steal. Great durability, awesome sheath, unique blade grind. The sharpness out of the box isn\t top notch, but for the duties that a bushcraft knife does, you should be prepared to sharpen it often anyways.Going back to the sheath, I\m going to say it\s worth 20 dollars by itself. It\s nothing fancy but just a nice quality that you don\t often see. The leather smells great too, even with age. The blade looks great too, mine had a blued swirl finish which hasn\t worn off yet. The handle is simple but sturdy.If I had to give 1 con it would be that the knife slightly resembles a steak knife, but that doesn\t bother me.'
B003D9RBMU|21990232556627|'5.0,I\m not sure why the Sapien isn\t more popular as it seems to not get mentioned very often, which is a shame as this is a handy little knife. The grips are very comfortable and fit well into everyone\s hands that have looked at it. The Sapien has a versatile blade design that allows for many uses. Hope that more people will give the Sapien a try as they will not be disappointed. Really like the knife and think Condor T&K has some very good products at more than reasonable costs.'
B003D9RBMU|21990232561921|'5.0,I love this little knife. The only thing I would change is a better grip or way your hand won\t slide onto the blade under certain conditions. Otherwise, this is a great camp knife for all your utility purposes. Does very well at feather sticks and some fine carving. Certainly not meant for firewood processing but all in all a very useful addition to my kit. I do carry a number of knives for different purposes and as spares when weight is not an issue.The knife came awesomely sharp out of the box.and put to use immediately. I have not had the chance to put it though more vigorous testing but will add to this review when I am able.Meantime, I do recommend this knife as a good knife for light duty camp chores.UPDATE:After using this knife which is excellent and has performed flawlessly for a while now I have to add a negative point regarding the very well made but much to big sheath. While being made of excellent quality leather and well crafted the sheath does not fit the knife at all and is just way to big allowing the knife to continually fall or pop out. It bounces around in the sheath and can just pop out if you are on a run or climb so I will have to do some modification to the sheath to get it to stay in the sheath. Very poor job on the fit of this sheath and certain;y a problem with quality control. Whoever passed that through should be fired.'
B003D9RBMU|21990232561945|'4.0,I havent used it yet , but , it seems like the other Condor knives I own. The steel is good , the grind is slightly uneven. The handle is smooth and well shaped. The sheath , as always , is top notch and worth the price of the knife. I may buy another one of these , just to use the sheath for a Mora. The knife is in fact similar to a Mora. But , I think with the width being more narrow , I should get a better cut for carving. I will update as soon as I have a chance to compare the two.'
B003D9RBMU|21990232565865|'4.0,Putting aside the funky name, this knife is a solid value.  Fits well in hand just keep the blade oiled and this should last forever providing service with a smile.  What more can you ask for. Condor is really providing cost performance value in their knives. The fit, function and finish is spot on. No problems go ahead and get it.'

B001C74GM8|6192|'5.0,My second night scope.  First was in 2004 and did not compare to this one.I am planning on using it for night pellet rifle &#34;Ratting&#34; - look it up on youtube.  It works well for about 150 feet and even better with an IR flashlight.  Is adjustable for L/R and elevation.  You can turn the built in IR and crosshair on/off using the optional remote switch.I was playing with it around the neighborhood - not attached to anything, and you can see animals eyes reflect back at you.  I can\\t wait.  Definitely worth the purchase.  If you are going to use it for night time boar hunting, I am not sure you will have the magnification for distance as it is only a 1.5x , but for my purpose, it is perfect.'

B001C74GM8|2199023256728|'4.0,I had two of the 1.5 x 42 yukon scopes and they are ok if you know what to expect out of a gen 1 tube and $400 also if you can get past the ugly green that is different colors in different spots (why not black guys?) . The problem was that besides the normal fish eye effect that is common with gen 1 scopes , it was lacking in the focusing department . Yes it had the back ring but that really is just for the cross hairs to clear up and not be doubled while looking at them . I could see some what clearly with the cover down at very short range inside the house ( like 10 feet ) when you opened the cover it was a total blur . Outside I would really have to fight the double cross hair problem when looking at something specific ,I do not wear glasses nor need them... I saw a rabbit one time at about 30 yds and knew it was a rabbit but I really could not identify it clearly . Deer or hog size game you can see but you are limited to under 100 yds trust me 75 should be the limit really . I searched for a scope that could clear things up and be reasonable . I searched for days and just got sick of hunting for one that wasn\\t $1500 or more . I also learned through my research that Sightmark owns every company I was looking at ( yukon , pulsar and one other company its not ATN ) also that listings of gen 1+ and 2 gen + means nothing other then current production tubes . The life time warranty is only for 3 years on yukon and sightmark scopes tubes which is better than any other company . I heard too many hit and misses with ATN products and decided to avoid them . I looked at this scope Yukon Nvrs Tactical 2.5X50 with Internal Focusing Night Vision Rifle scope,and saw it had an adjustable objective ring in addition to the rear ring adjustment for $150 more..and it also has is a weaver rail on the other side (not shown) to mount an IR light or laser that the 1.5 does not have and its BLACK!!!! way better looking . I took it out at night with 3/4 moon and minimum cloud cover....OMG it is totally worth the extra $150 looking at the same places that I did with the two other 1.5 x 42 scopes. It was the difference between being ok with a product or totally satisfied and happy .The 1.5 x 42 only gives you a small center that is useful... the outer edges are of no use and that is a known issue with gen 1 so I understood . This scope maybe due to the focusing objective ring may have helped in correcting the problem a little because I have much better edge to edge clarity . Now when I look at something that might be blurred I just roll the front ring and its clear as can be. My cross hairs are on point after a turn with the rear ring .The person that stated he could not get it sighted in through the pin hole ..well your not suppose to do it that way, it even tells you in the instructions to do it at night with the cover up. I have not sighted it in yet but the others were done that way with no problems and if this one don\\t then I will let you know . The adjustments knobs have positive clicks and seem to track well .The IR light that is mounted on the scope is decent for about 75 to 100 yds and I think a added IR light would really light things up after looking at some videos, so I ordered one from here and am still waiting for it from China ...There is a great review on the 2.5 x 50 scope on youtube showing you what you will actually see when using the scope, you just have to put yukon scope in the search and it shows a dirt road with power poles . The image in the video does not do it Justis compared to actually looking through it in real life . The other scopes are set up for a locked in focus for the masses , this one lets you adjust for each individuals eyes . So people when asking yourself should I get this one or the cheaper one ???? think about this..... how many times have you gone through $150 with a tank of gas thats gone in less than a week with going to dinner and the movies added in ????..Them items are gone now but invested here will last for years and give you a great viewing experience every time you look through it instead of saying , I wish i could see a little farther and what is that over there ? ....I can tell you its a rabbit now for sure ...I hope this helps some of you in your decision.'
B001C74GM8|2199023257584|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing..

B001C74GM8|2199023260758|'2.0,Got the NVRS in several weeks ago, bore sighted and laser sighted it in at the house at 60 yrds. Due to all the rain and snow didn\t get to the range until today. About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing.. I wish it came in \"\"black\"\" but with that said.. the OD Green is better looking than the pictures. Once wrapped with ghillie.. it matters not. I actually thought I might been disappointed with this purchase. \"\"IF\"\" it remains working as it has at the start.. it was well worth the low cost.Note: Mine says 3 year warranty not lifetime.. which was one of the buying factors. Nor did I recieve a mail in warranty card in the box. I did fill one out at their website and will hang onto that information along with the receipt if needed in the future! They say warranty only good if you return it within the first 30 days. I wont take away a star for this because this scope still has me grining and owning the night as advertised.'"

B001C74GM8|4398046516427|'5.0,My second night scope.  First was in 2004 and did not compare to this one.I am planning on using it for night pellet rifle &#34;Ratting&#34; - look it up on youtube.  It works well for about 150 feet and even better with an IR flashlight.  Is adjustable for L/R and elevation.  You can turn the built in IR and crosshair on/off using the optional remote switch.I was playing with it around the neighborhood - not attached to anything, and you can see animals eyes reflect back at you.  I can\\t wait.  Definitely worth the purchase.  If you are going to use it for night time boar hunting, I am not sure you will have the magnification for distance as it is only a 1.5x , but for my purpose, it is perfect.'

About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

B001C74GM8|10995116283190|'5.0,I did my research before purchasing this scope. I read the few customer reviews here on Amazon and then hit google to find more reviews. I read every one I could find.One of my big requirements were that I wanted something that used AA or AAA batteries and this fit the bill.I do not have this mounted yet, so I\\ve been using it as a monocle. A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night. It was a clear evening so I assume there was a ton of ambient natural IR light, but I was amazed!So far this was money well spent, this thing is fantastic!This was only the first part of my test I\\ll update my review as time goes on.'
B001C74GM8|10995116286035|'5.0,It takes some getting used to but worked fine. Saw deer eating apples , they didn\t know we could see them. ( We weren\t after them, just watching) With the Armasight IR810 Detachable Long Range Infrared Illuminator the Gen 1 works great.'

I couldn\t afford 5, 10, 15 grand or more so I gave this a try. It had good reviews. Of course it\s not comparable to what I was provided by Gov. but I was pleasantly surprised. So far it\s well built. The night vision works. I have no black, dark or void spots whatsoever. I am extremely happy with this product, for the money.No regrets so far.I have taken it out and played with it. I bought it for my personal M4 platform in 5.56. I am still trying to figure if I am going to have to zero it at night or not. The reticle is red on a green field and reticle intensity is adjustable. This is not a scope I would want to use busting into a drug cartels compound but, in a civilian defensive mode it is a nice tool to have. For killing insurgent deer and wild boar and stuff, it should work nicely. Yea baby, eat more meat! Most of my shooting is precision shooting and practice. I may try to hunt pigs and coyotes at night if it\s legal. I need to check local laws on night hunting first.Something I noticed, When there is heavy brush or bush, trees and stuff up close, it tends to wash out the picture some. Only with the IR light on. Too much light reflecting. It\s easy to flip off the IR though and go into a more passive NV mode without Infrared Assist.After I zero it and shoot a few hundred rounds at night I will weigh in and give my opinion again. I hope this review helps someone else. Have fun, Be Safe, and Semper Fidelis! \"\"always faithful\"\"'"

Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

I now can see what goes &#34;bump in the night&#34; without giving away my position with a flash light. My only real complaint is the color... its not that it is a ugly color green, its just it would look so much better if it matched my M4.  but comes off in seconds to switch out with a red dot or something else.  It def looks like a thousand dollar scope, though. Also, the weight in not bad on the rifle,  what the hell... you can see in the dark.  Just be carful of your eye... the first night I had it I was walking my property for about a half hour because it was so cool, but when I came back indoors my eye was cloudy for 10 mins or so. lol  but all in all, its Bad Ass!'
B001C74GM8|6858|'5.0,It takes some getting used to but worked fine. Saw deer eating apples , they didn\t know we could see them. ( We weren\t after them, just watching) With the Armasight IR810 Detachable Long Range Infrared Illuminator the Gen 1 works great.'

B001C74GM8|2199023258051|"'5.0,OK, I had this in my Amazon Basket. The price dropped to 389.99 W No Tax or Shipping. As I was inpro the price jumped back to 399.99. It was reduced less than a day here so; I bought from B&H.PhotoVideo; online store instead. 389.99 W No Tax or Shipping. B&H; is awesome and I had it well packaged and within 2 days.Now, I have been a US Marine for 23 years. I am getting out of the game due to combat injuries, Left leg full of metal ect. I have used Uncle Sams\ NV platforms for years. NV Scopes on .50 Cal, Aviation Helmet NV Goggles for aviation ops ect. The latest Generation stuff available.I was very skeptical. I couldn\t afford 5, 10, 15 grand or more so I gave this a try. It had good reviews. Of course it\s not comparable to what I was provided by Gov. but I was pleasantly surprised. So far it\s well built. The night vision works. I have no black, dark or void spots whatsoever. I am extremely happy with this product, for the money.No regrets so far.I have taken it out and played with it. I bought it for my personal M4 platform in 5.56. I am still trying to figure if I am going to have to zero it at night or not. The reticle is red on a green field and reticle intensity is adjustable. This is not a scope I would want to use busting into a drug cartels compound but, in a civilian defensive mode it is a nice tool to have. For killing insurgent deer and wild boar and stuff, it should work nicely. Yea baby, eat more meat! Most of my shooting is precision shooting and practice. I may try to hunt pigs and coyotes at night if it\s legal. I need to check local laws on night hunting first.Something I noticed, When there is heavy brush or bush, trees and stuff up close, it tends to wash out the picture some. Only with the IR light on. Too much light reflecting. It\s easy to flip off the IR though and go into a more passive NV mode without Infrared Assist.After I zero it and shoot a few hundred rounds at night I will weigh in and give my opinion again. I hope this review helps someone else. Have fun, Be Safe, and Semper Fidelis! \"\"always faithful\"\"'"

B001C74GM8|2199023266391|'5.0,I did my research before purchasing this scope. I read the few customer reviews here on Amazon and then hit google to find more reviews. I read every one I could find.One of my big requirements were that I wanted something that used AA or AAA batteries and this fit the bill.I do not have this mounted yet, so I\\ve been using it as a monocle. A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night. It was a clear evening so I assume there was a ton of ambient natural IR light, but I was amazed!So far this was money well spent, this thing is fantastic!This was only the first part of my test I\\ll update my review as time goes on.'

B001C74GM8|6597069769999|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing.. I wish it came in \"\"black\"\" but with that said.. the OD Green is better looking than the pictures. Once wrapped with ghillie.. it matters not. I actually thought I might been disappointed with this purchase. \"\"IF\"\" it remains working as it has at the start.. it was well worth the low cost.Note: Mine says 3 year warranty not lifetime.. which was one of the buying factors. Nor did I recieve a mail in warranty card in the box. I did fill one out at their website and will hang onto that information along with the receipt if needed in the future! They say warranty only good if you return it within the first 30 days. I wont take away a star for this because this scope still has me grining and owning the night as advertised.'"
B001C74GM8|6597069777158|'4.0,I had two of the 1.5 x 42 yukon scopes and they are ok if you know what to expect out of a gen 1 tube and $400 also if you can get past the ugly green that is different colors in different spots (why not black guys?) . The problem was that besides the normal fish eye effect that is common with gen 1 scopes , it was lacking in the focusing department . Yes it had the back ring but that really is just for the cross hairs to clear up and not be doubled while looking at them . I could see some what clearly with the cover down at very short range inside the house ( like 10 feet ) when you opened the cover it was a total blur . Outside I would really have to fight the double cross hair problem when looking at something specific ,I do not wear glasses nor need them... I saw a rabbit one time at about 30 yds and knew it was a rabbit but I really could not identify it clearly . Deer or hog size game you can see but you are limited to under 100 yds trust me 75 should be the limit really . I searched for a scope that could clear things up and be reasonable . I searched for days and just got sick of hunting for one that wasn\\t $1500 or more . I also learned through my research that Sightmark owns every company I was looking at ( yukon , pulsar and one other company its not ATN ) also that listings of gen 1+ and 2 gen + means nothing other then current production tubes . The life time warranty is only for 3 years on yukon and sightmark scopes tubes which is better than any other company . I heard too many hit and misses with ATN products and decided to avoid them . I looked at this scope Yukon Nvrs Tactical 2.5X50 with Internal Focusing Night Vision Rifle scope,and saw it had an adjustable objective ring in addition to the rear ring adjustment for $150 more..and it also has is a weaver rail on the other side (not shown) to mount an IR light or laser that the 1.5 does not have and its BLACK!!!! way better looking . I took it out at night with 3/4 moon and minimum cloud cover....OMG it is totally worth the extra $150 looking at the same places that I did with the two other 1.5 x 42 scopes. It was the difference between being ok with a product or totally satisfied and happy .The 1.5 x 42 only gives you a small center that is useful... the outer edges are of no use and that is a known issue with gen 1 so I understood . This scope maybe due to the focusing objective ring may have helped in correcting the problem a little because I have much better edge to edge clarity . Now when I look at something that might be blurred I just roll the front ring and its clear as can be. My cross hairs are on point after a turn with the rear ring .The person that stated he could not get it sighted in through the pin hole ..well your not suppose to do it that way, it even tells you in the instructions to do it at night with the cover up. I have not sighted it in yet but the others were done that way with no problems and if this one don\\t then I will let you know . The adjustments knobs have positive clicks and seem to track well .The IR light that is mounted on the scope is decent for about 75 to 100 yds and I think a added IR light would really light things up after looking at some videos, so I ordered one from here and am still waiting for it from China ...There is a great review on the 2.5 x 50 scope on youtube showing you what you will actually see when using the scope, you just have to put yukon scope in the search and it shows a dirt road with power poles . The image in the video does not do it Justis compared to actually looking through it in real life . The other scopes are set up for a locked in focus for the masses , this one lets you adjust for each individuals eyes . So people when asking yourself should I get this one or the cheaper one ???? think about this..... how many times have you gone through $150 with a tank of gas thats gone in less than a week with going to dinner and the movies added in ????..Them items are gone now but invested here will last for years and give you a great viewing experience every time you look through it instead of saying , I wish i could see a little farther and what is that over there ? ....I can tell you its a rabbit now for sure ...I hope this helps some of you in your decision.'

B001C74GM8|15393162797095|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing..

B001C74GM8|17592186047294|'5.0,It is what it is...  for the money it is exactly what you paid for.  Unless you have a buddy who has a better Night Vision scope... you will think its Awesome.  I now can see what goes &#34;bump in the night&#34; without giving away my position with a flash light. My only real complaint is the color... its not that it is a ugly color green, its just it would look so much better if it matched my M4.  but comes off in seconds to switch out with a red dot or something else.  It def looks like a thousand dollar scope, though. Also, the weight in not bad on the rifle,  what the hell... you can see in the dark.  Just be carful of your eye... the first night I had it I was walking my property for about a half hour because it was so cool, but when I came back indoors my eye was cloudy for 10 mins or so. lol  but all in all, its Bad Ass!'

B001C74GM8|19791209307698|'4.0,I had two of the 1.5 x 42 yukon scopes and they are ok if you know what to expect out of a gen 1 tube and $400 also if you can get past the ugly green that is different colors in different spots (why not black guys?) . The problem was that besides the normal fish eye effect that is common with gen 1 scopes , it was lacking in the focusing department . Yes it had the back ring but that really is just for the cross hairs to clear up and not be doubled while looking at them . I could see some what clearly with the cover down at very short range inside the house ( like 10 feet ) when you opened the cover it was a total blur . Outside I would really have to fight the double cross hair problem when looking at something specific ,I do not wear glasses nor need them... I saw a rabbit one time at about 30 yds and knew it was a rabbit but I really could not identify it clearly . Deer or hog size game you can see but you are limited to under 100 yds trust me 75 should be the limit really . I searched for a scope that could clear things up and be reasonable . I searched for days and just got sick of hunting for one that wasn\\t $1500 or more . I also learned through my research that Sightmark owns every company I was looking at ( yukon , pulsar and one other company its not ATN ) also that listings of gen 1+ and 2 gen + means nothing other then current production tubes . The life time warranty is only for 3 years on yukon and sightmark scopes tubes which is better than any other company . I heard too many hit and misses with ATN products and decided to avoid them . I looked at this scope Yukon Nvrs Tactical 2.5X50 with Internal Focusing Night Vision Rifle scope,and saw it had an adjustable objective ring in addition to the rear ring adjustment for $150 more..and it also has is a weaver rail on the other side (not shown) to mount an IR light or laser that the 1.5 does not have and its BLACK!!!! way better looking . I took it out at night with 3/4 moon and minimum cloud cover....OMG it is totally worth the extra $150 looking at the same places that I did with the two other 1.5 x 42 scopes. It was the difference between being ok with a product or totally satisfied and happy .The 1.5 x 42 only gives you a small center that is useful... the outer edges are of no use and that is a known issue with gen 1 so I understood . This scope maybe due to the focusing objective ring may have helped in correcting the problem a little because I have much better edge to edge clarity . Now when I look at something that might be blurred I just roll the front ring and its clear as can be. My cross hairs are on point after a turn with the rear ring .The person that stated he could not get it sighted in through the pin hole ..well your not suppose to do it that way, it even tells you in the instructions to do it at night with the cover up. I have not sighted it in yet but the others were done that way with no problems and if this one don\\t then I will let you know . The adjustments knobs have positive clicks and seem to track well .The IR light that is mounted on the scope is decent for about 75 to 100 yds and I think a added IR light would really light things up after looking at some videos, so I ordered one from here and am still waiting for it from China ...There is a great review on the 2.5 x 50 scope on youtube showing you what you will actually see when using the scope, you just have to put yukon scope in the search and it shows a dirt road with power poles . The image in the video does not do it Justis compared to actually looking through it in real life . The other scopes are set up for a locked in focus for the masses , this one lets you adjust for each individuals eyes . So people when asking yourself should I get this one or the cheaper one ???? think about this..... how many times have you gone through $150 with a tank of gas thats gone in less than a week with going to dinner and the movies added in ????..Them items are gone now but invested here will last for years and give you a great viewing experience every time you look through it instead of saying , I wish i could see a little farther and what is that over there ? ....I can tell you its a rabbit now for sure ...I hope this helps some of you in your decision.'

B001C74GM8|30786325581635|'2.0,Got the NVRS in several weeks ago, bore sighted and laser sighted it in at the house at 60 yrds. Due to all the rain and snow didn\t get to the range until today. About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'
B001C74GM8|30786325586538|'5.0,My second night scope.  First was in 2004 and did not compare to this one.I am planning on using it for night pellet rifle &#34;Ratting&#34; - look it up on youtube.  It works well for about 150 feet and even better with an IR flashlight.  Is adjustable for L/R and elevation.  You can turn the built in IR and crosshair on/off using the optional remote switch.I was playing with it around the neighborhood - not attached to anything, and you can see animals eyes reflect back at you.  I can\\t wait.  Definitely worth the purchase.  If you are going to use it for night time boar hunting, I am not sure you will have the magnification for distance as it is only a 1.5x , but for my purpose, it is perfect.'

About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money.

I now can see what goes &#34;bump in the night&#34; without giving away my position with a flash light. My only real complaint is the color... its not that it is a ugly color green, its just it would look so much better if it matched my M4.  but comes off in seconds to switch out with a red dot or something else.  It def looks like a thousand dollar scope, though. Also, the weight in not bad on the rifle,  what the hell... you can see in the dark.  Just be carful of your eye... the first night I had it I was walking my property for about a half hour because it was so cool, but when I came back indoors my eye was cloudy for 10 mins or so. lol  but all in all, its Bad Ass!'

B001C74GM8|30786325581265|'5.0,I did my research before purchasing this scope. I read the few customer reviews here on Amazon and then hit google to find more reviews. I read every one I could find.One of my big requirements were that I wanted something that used AA or AAA batteries and this fit the bill.I do not have this mounted yet, so I\\ve been using it as a monocle. A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night. It was a clear evening so I assume there was a ton of ambient natural IR light, but I was amazed!So far this was money well spent, this thing is fantastic!This was only the first part of my test I\\ll update my review as time goes on.'

B001C74GM8|30786325584694|'4.0,I had two of the 1.5 x 42 yukon scopes and they are ok if you know what to expect out of a gen 1 tube and $400 also if you can get past the ugly green that is different colors in different spots (why not black guys?) . The problem was that besides the normal fish eye effect that is common with gen 1 scopes , it was lacking in the focusing department . Yes it had the back ring but that really is just for the cross hairs to clear up and not be doubled while looking at them . I could see some what clearly with the cover down at very short range inside the house ( like 10 feet ) when you opened the cover it was a total blur . Outside I would really have to fight the double cross hair problem when looking at something specific ,I do not wear glasses nor need them... I saw a rabbit one time at about 30 yds and knew it was a rabbit but I really could not identify it clearly . Deer or hog size game you can see but you are limited to under 100 yds trust me 75 should be the limit really . I searched for a scope that could clear things up and be reasonable . I searched for days and just got sick of hunting for one that wasn\\t $1500 or more . I also learned through my research that Sightmark owns every company I was looking at ( yukon , pulsar and one other company its not ATN ) also that listings of gen 1+ and 2 gen + means nothing other then current production tubes . The life time warranty is only for 3 years on yukon and sightmark scopes tubes which is better than any other company . I heard too many hit and misses with ATN products and decided to avoid them . I looked at this scope Yukon Nvrs Tactical 2.5X50 with Internal Focusing Night Vision Rifle scope,and saw it had an adjustable objective ring in addition to the rear ring adjustment for $150 more..and it also has is a weaver rail on the other side (not shown) to mount an IR light or laser that the 1.5 does not have and its BLACK!!!! way better looking . I took it out at night with 3/4 moon and minimum cloud cover....OMG it is totally worth the extra $150 looking at the same places that I did with the two other 1.5 x 42 scopes. It was the difference between being ok with a product or totally satisfied and happy .The 1.5 x 42 only gives you a small center that is useful... the outer edges are of no use and that is a known issue with gen 1 so I understood . This scope maybe due to the focusing objective ring may have helped in correcting the problem a little because I have much better edge to edge clarity . Now when I look at something that might be blurred I just roll the front ring and its clear as can be. My cross hairs are on point after a turn with the rear ring .The person that stated he could not get it sighted in through the pin hole ..well your not suppose to do it that way, it even tells you in the instructions to do it at night with the cover up. I have not sighted it in yet but the others were done that way with no problems and if this one don\\t then I will let you know . The adjustments knobs have positive clicks and seem to track well .The IR light that is mounted on the scope is decent for about 75 to 100 yds and I think a added IR light would really light things up after looking at some videos, so I ordered one from here and am still waiting for it from China ...There is a great review on the 2.5 x 50 scope on youtube showing you what you will actually see when using the scope, you just have to put yukon scope in the search and it shows a dirt road with power poles . The image in the video does not do it Justis compared to actually looking through it in real life . The other scopes are set up for a locked in focus for the masses , this one lets you adjust for each individuals eyes . So people when asking yourself should I get this one or the cheaper one ???? think about this..... how many times have you gone through $150 with a tank of gas thats gone in less than a week with going to dinner and the movies added in ????..Them items are gone now but invested here will last for years and give you a great viewing experience every time you look through it instead of saying , I wish i could see a little farther and what is that over there ? ....I can tell you its a rabbit now for sure ...I hope this helps some of you in your decision.'

B001C74GM8|2199023263018|"'5.0,OK, I had this in my Amazon Basket. The price dropped to 389.99 W No Tax or Shipping. As I was inpro the price jumped back to 399.99. It was reduced less than a day here so; I bought from B&H.PhotoVideo; online store instead. 389.99 W No Tax or Shipping. B&H; is awesome and I had it well packaged and within 2 days.Now, I have been a US Marine for 23 years. I am getting out of the game due to combat injuries, Left leg full of metal ect. I have used Uncle Sams\ NV platforms for years. NV Scopes on .50 Cal, Aviation Helmet NV Goggles for aviation ops ect. The latest Generation stuff available.I was very skeptical. I couldn\t afford 5, 10, 15 grand or more so I gave this a try. It had good reviews. Of course it\s not comparable to what I was provided by Gov. but I was pleasantly surprised. So far it\s well built. The night vision works. I have no black, dark or void spots whatsoever. I am extremely happy with this product, for the money.No regrets so far.I have taken it out and played with it. I bought it for my personal M4 platform in 5.56. I am still trying to figure if I am going to have to zero it at night or not. The reticle is red on a green field and reticle intensity is adjustable. This is not a scope I would want to use busting into a drug cartels compound but, in a civilian defensive mode it is a nice tool to have. For killing insurgent deer and wild boar and stuff, it should work nicely. Yea baby, eat more meat! Most of my shooting is precision shooting and practice. I may try to hunt pigs and coyotes at night if it\s legal. I need to check local laws on night hunting first.Something I noticed, When there is heavy brush or bush, trees and stuff up close, it tends to wash out the picture some. Only with the IR light on. Too much light reflecting. It\s easy to flip off the IR though and go into a more passive NV mode without Infrared Assist.After I zero it and shoot a few hundred rounds at night I will weigh in and give my opinion again. I hope this review helps someone else. Have fun, Be Safe, and Semper Fidelis! \"\"always faithful\"\"'"
B001C74GM8|6597069768998|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing.. I wish it came in \"\"black\"\" but with that said.. the OD Green is better looking than the pictures. Once wrapped with ghillie.. it matters not. I actually thought I might been disappointed with this purchase. \"\"IF\"\" it remains working as it has at the start.. it was well worth the low cost.Note: Mine says 3 year warranty not lifetime.. which was one of the buying factors.

About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good.

B001C74GM8|8796093027404|'5.0,My second night scope.  First was in 2004 and did not compare to this one.I am planning on using it for night pellet rifle &#34;Ratting&#34; - look it up on youtube.  It works well for about 150 feet and even better with an IR flashlight.  Is adjustable for L/R and elevation.  You can turn the built in IR and crosshair on/off using the optional remote switch.I was playing with it around the neighborhood - not attached to anything, and you can see animals eyes reflect back at you.  I can\\t wait.  Definitely worth the purchase.  If you are going to use it for night time boar hunting, I am not sure you will have the magnification for distance as it is only a 1.5x , but for my purpose, it is perfect.'

I couldn\t afford 5, 10, 15 grand or more so I gave this a try. It had good reviews. Of course it\s not comparable to what I was provided by Gov. but I was pleasantly surprised. So far it\s well built. The night vision works. I have no black, dark or void spots whatsoever. I am extremely happy with this product, for the money.No regrets so far.I have taken it out and played with it. I bought it for my personal M4 platform in 5.56. I am still trying to figure if I am going to have to zero it at night or not. The reticle is red on a green field and reticle intensity is adjustable. This is not a scope I would want to use busting into a drug cartels compound but, in a civilian defensive mode it is a nice tool to have. For killing insurgent deer and wild boar and stuff, it should work nicely. Yea baby, eat more meat! Most of my shooting is precision shooting and practice.

I need to check local laws on night hunting first.Something I noticed, When there is heavy brush or bush, trees and stuff up close, it tends to wash out the picture some. Only with the IR light on.

B001C74GM8|10995116278306|'5.0,I did my research before purchasing this scope. I read the few customer reviews here on Amazon and then hit google to find more reviews.

A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night.

About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

B001C74GM8|19791209309953|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing.. I wish it came in \"\"black\"\" but with that said.. the OD Green is better looking than the pictures. Once wrapped with ghillie.. it matters not. I actually thought I might been disappointed with this purchase. \"\"IF\"\" it remains working as it has at the start.. it was well worth the low cost.Note: Mine says 3 year warranty not lifetime.. which was one of the buying factors. Nor did I recieve a mail in warranty card in the box. I did fill one out at their website and will hang onto that information along with the receipt if needed in the future! They say warranty only good if you return it within the first 30 days. I wont take away a star for this because this scope still has me grining and owning the night as advertised.'"

B001C74GM8|28587302326711|'5.0,So far, I like it. I\\ve tested it out indoors. had a small night light for the ambient light. i had to flip on the IR setting. it works well with low light. looking forward to hog hunting'
B001C74GM8|30786325582421|'4.0,I had two of the 1.5 x 42 yukon scopes and they are ok if you know what to expect out of a gen 1 tube and $400 also if you can get past the ugly green that is different colors in different spots (why not black guys?) . The problem was that besides the normal fish eye effect that is common with gen 1 scopes , it was lacking in the focusing department . Yes it had the back ring but that really is just for the cross hairs to clear up and not be doubled while looking at them . I could see some what clearly with the cover down at very short range inside the house ( like 10 feet ) when you opened the cover it was a total blur . Outside I would really have to fight the double cross hair problem when looking at something specific ,I do not wear glasses nor need them... I saw a rabbit one time at about 30 yds and knew it was a rabbit but I really could not identify it clearly . Deer or hog size game you can see but you are limited to under 100 yds trust me 75 should be the limit really . I searched for a scope that could clear things up and be reasonable . I searched for days and just got sick of hunting for one that wasn\\t $1500 or more . I also learned through my research that Sightmark owns every company I was looking at ( yukon , pulsar and one other company its not ATN ) also that listings of gen 1+ and 2 gen + means nothing other then current production tubes . The life time warranty is only for 3 years on yukon and sightmark scopes tubes which is better than any other company . I heard too many hit and misses with ATN products and decided to avoid them . I looked at this scope Yukon Nvrs Tactical 2.5X50 with Internal Focusing Night Vision Rifle scope,and saw it had an adjustable objective ring in addition to the rear ring adjustment for $150 more..and it also has is a weaver rail on the other side (not shown) to mount an IR light or laser that the 1.5 does not have and its BLACK!!!! way better looking . I took it out at night with 3/4 moon and minimum cloud cover....OMG it is totally worth the extra $150 looking at the same places that I did with the two other 1.5 x 42 scopes. It was the difference between being ok with a product or totally satisfied and happy .The 1.5 x 42 only gives you a small center that is useful... the outer edges are of no use and that is a known issue with gen 1 so I understood . This scope maybe due to the focusing objective ring may have helped in correcting the problem a little because I have much better edge to edge clarity . Now when I look at something that might be blurred I just roll the front ring and its clear as can be. My cross hairs are on point after a turn with the rear ring .The person that stated he could not get it sighted in through the pin hole ..well your not suppose to do it that way, it even tells you in the instructions to do it at night with the cover up. I have not sighted it in yet but the others were done that way with no problems and if this one don\\t then I will let you know . The adjustments knobs have positive clicks and seem to track well .The IR light that is mounted on the scope is decent for about 75 to 100 yds and I think a added IR light would really light things up after looking at some videos, so I ordered one from here and am still waiting for it from China ...There is a great review on the 2.5 x 50 scope on youtube showing you what you will actually see when using the scope, you just have to put yukon scope in the search and it shows a dirt road with power poles . The image in the video does not do it Justis compared to actually looking through it in real life . The other scopes are set up for a locked in focus for the masses , this one lets you adjust for each individuals eyes . So people when asking yourself should I get this one or the cheaper one ???? think about this..... how many times have you gone through $150 with a tank of gas thats gone in less than a week with going to dinner and the movies added in ????..Them items are gone now but invested here will last for years and give you a great viewing experience every time you look through it instead of saying , I wish i could see a little farther and what is that over there ? ....I can tell you its a rabbit now for sure ...I hope this helps some of you in your decision.'

About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money.

Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

B001C74GM8|84|'5.0,It is what it is...  for the money it is exactly what you paid for.  Unless you have a buddy who has a better Night Vision scope... you will think its Awesome.  I now can see what goes &#34;bump in the night&#34; without giving away my position with a flash light. My only real complaint is the color... its not that it is a ugly color green, its just it would look so much better if it matched my M4.  but comes off in seconds to switch out with a red dot or something else.  It def looks like a thousand dollar scope, though. Also, the weight in not bad on the rifle,  what the hell... you can see in the dark.  Just be carful of your eye... the first night I had it I was walking my property for about a half hour because it was so cool, but when I came back indoors my eye was cloudy for 10 mins or so. lol  but all in all, its Bad Ass!'

A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night.

B001C74GM8|4398046511726|'4.0,I had two of the 1.5 x 42 yukon scopes and they are ok if you know what to expect out of a gen 1 tube and $400 also if you can get past the ugly green that is different colors in different spots (why not black guys?) . The problem was that besides the normal fish eye effect that is common with gen 1 scopes , it was lacking in the focusing department . Yes it had the back ring but that really is just for the cross hairs to clear up and not be doubled while looking at them . I could see some what clearly with the cover down at very short range inside the house ( like 10 feet ) when you opened the cover it was a total blur . Outside I would really have to fight the double cross hair problem when looking at something specific ,I do not wear glasses nor need them... I saw a rabbit one time at about 30 yds and knew it was a rabbit but I really could not identify it clearly . Deer or hog size game you can see but you are limited to under 100 yds trust me 75 should be the limit really . I searched for a scope that could clear things up and be reasonable . I searched for days and just got sick of hunting for one that wasn\\t $1500 or more . I also learned through my research that Sightmark owns every company I was looking at ( yukon , pulsar and one other company its not ATN ) also that listings of gen 1+ and 2 gen + means nothing other then current production tubes . The life time warranty is only for 3 years on yukon and sightmark scopes tubes which is better than any other company . I heard too many hit and misses with ATN products and decided to avoid them . I looked at this scope Yukon Nvrs Tactical 2.5X50 with Internal Focusing Night Vision Rifle scope,and saw it had an adjustable objective ring in addition to the rear ring adjustment for $150 more..and it also has is a weaver rail on the other side (not shown) to mount an IR light or laser that the 1.5 does not have and its BLACK!!!! way better looking . I took it out at night with 3/4 moon and minimum cloud cover....OMG it is totally worth the extra $150 looking at the same places that I did with the two other 1.5 x 42 scopes. It was the difference between being ok with a product or totally satisfied and happy .The 1.5 x 42 only gives you a small center that is useful... the outer edges are of no use and that is a known issue with gen 1 so I understood . This scope maybe due to the focusing objective ring may have helped in correcting the problem a little because I have much better edge to edge clarity . Now when I look at something that might be blurred I just roll the front ring and its clear as can be. My cross hairs are on point after a turn with the rear ring .The person that stated he could not get it sighted in through the pin hole ..well your not suppose to do it that way, it even tells you in the instructions to do it at night with the cover up. I have not sighted it in yet but the others were done that way with no problems and if this one don\\t then I will let you know . The adjustments knobs have positive clicks and seem to track well .The IR light that is mounted on the scope is decent for about 75 to 100 yds and I think a added IR light would really light things up after looking at some videos, so I ordered one from here and am still waiting for it from China ...There is a great review on the 2.5 x 50 scope on youtube showing you what you will actually see when using the scope, you just have to put yukon scope in the search and it shows a dirt road with power poles . The image in the video does not do it Justis compared to actually looking through it in real life . The other scopes are set up for a locked in focus for the masses , this one lets you adjust for each individuals eyes . So people when asking yourself should I get this one or the cheaper one ???? think about this..... how many times have you gone through $150 with a tank of gas thats gone in less than a week with going to dinner and the movies added in ????..Them items are gone now but invested here will last for years and give you a great viewing experience every time you look through it instead of saying , I wish i could see a little farther and what is that over there ? ....I can tell you its a rabbit now for sure ...I hope this helps some of you in your decision.'
B001C74GM8|4398046517200|"'5.0,OK, I had this in my Amazon Basket. The price dropped to 389.99 W No Tax or Shipping. As I was inpro the price jumped back to 399.99. It was reduced less than a day here so; I bought from B&H.PhotoVideo; online store instead. 389.99 W No Tax or Shipping. B&H; is awesome and I had it well packaged and within 2 days.Now, I have been a US Marine for 23 years. I am getting out of the game due to combat injuries, Left leg full of metal ect. I have used Uncle Sams\ NV platforms for years. NV Scopes on .50 Cal, Aviation Helmet NV Goggles for aviation ops ect. The latest Generation stuff available.I was very skeptical. I couldn\t afford 5, 10, 15 grand or more so I gave this a try. It had good reviews. Of course it\s not comparable to what I was provided by Gov. but I was pleasantly surprised. So far it\s well built. The night vision works. I have no black, dark or void spots whatsoever. I am extremely happy with this product, for the money.No regrets so far.I have taken it out and played with it. I bought it for my personal M4 platform in 5.56. I am still trying to figure if I am going to have to zero it at night or not. The reticle is red on a green field and reticle intensity is adjustable. This is not a scope I would want to use busting into a drug cartels compound but, in a civilian defensive mode it is a nice tool to have. For killing insurgent deer and wild boar and stuff, it should work nicely. Yea baby, eat more meat! Most of my shooting is precision shooting and practice. I may try to hunt pigs and coyotes at night if it\s legal. I need to check local laws on night hunting first.Something I noticed, When there is heavy brush or bush, trees and stuff up close, it tends to wash out the picture some. Only with the IR light on. Too much light reflecting. It\s easy to flip off the IR though and go into a more passive NV mode without Infrared Assist.After I zero it and shoot a few hundred rounds at night I will weigh in and give my opinion again. I hope this review helps someone else. Have fun, Be Safe, and Semper Fidelis! \"\"always faithful\"\"'"

B001C74GM8|6597069773759|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing.. I wish it came in \"\"black\"\" but with that said.. the OD Green is better looking than the pictures. Once wrapped with ghillie.. it matters not. I actually thought I might been disappointed with this purchase. \"\"IF\"\" it remains working as it has at the start.. it was well worth the low cost.Note: Mine says 3 year warranty not lifetime.. which was one of the buying factors. Nor did I recieve a mail in warranty card in the box. I did fill one out at their website and will hang onto that information along with the receipt if needed in the future! They say warranty only good if you return it within the first 30 days. I wont take away a star for this because this scope still has me grining and owning the night as advertised.'"

B001C74GM8|19791209301275|'2.0,Got the NVRS in several weeks ago, bore sighted and laser sighted it in at the house at 60 yrds. Due to all the rain and snow didn\t get to the range until today. About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

B001C74GM8|24189255817156|'4.0,I had two of the 1.5 x 42 yukon scopes and they are ok if you know what to expect out of a gen 1 tube and $400 also if you can get past the ugly green that is different colors in different spots (why not black guys?) . The problem was that besides the normal fish eye effect that is common with gen 1 scopes , it was lacking in the focusing department . Yes it had the back ring but that really is just for the cross hairs to clear up and not be doubled while looking at them . I could see some what clearly with the cover down at very short range inside the house ( like 10 feet ) when you opened the cover it was a total blur . Outside I would really have to fight the double cross hair problem when looking at something specific ,I do not wear glasses nor need them... I saw a rabbit one time at about 30 yds and knew it was a rabbit but I really could not identify it clearly . Deer or hog size game you can see but you are limited to under 100 yds trust me 75 should be the limit really . I searched for a scope that could clear things up and be reasonable . I searched for days and just got sick of hunting for one that wasn\\t $1500 or more . I also learned through my research that Sightmark owns every company I was looking at ( yukon , pulsar and one other company its not ATN ) also that listings of gen 1+ and 2 gen + means nothing other then current production tubes . The life time warranty is only for 3 years on yukon and sightmark scopes tubes which is better than any other company . I heard too many hit and misses with ATN products and decided to avoid them . I looked at this scope Yukon Nvrs Tactical 2.5X50 with Internal Focusing Night Vision Rifle scope,and saw it had an adjustable objective ring in addition to the rear ring adjustment for $150 more..and it also has is a weaver rail on the other side (not shown) to mount an IR light or laser that the 1.5 does not have and its BLACK!!!! way better looking . I took it out at night with 3/4 moon and minimum cloud cover....OMG it is totally worth the extra $150 looking at the same places that I did with the two other 1.5 x 42 scopes. It was the difference between being ok with a product or totally satisfied and happy .The 1.5 x 42 only gives you a small center that is useful... the outer edges are of no use and that is a known issue with gen 1 so I understood . This scope maybe due to the focusing objective ring may have helped in correcting the problem a little because I have much better edge to edge clarity . Now when I look at something that might be blurred I just roll the front ring and its clear as can be. My cross hairs are on point after a turn with the rear ring .The person that stated he could not get it sighted in through the pin hole ..well your not suppose to do it that way, it even tells you in the instructions to do it at night with the cover up. I have not sighted it in yet but the others were done that way with no problems and if this one don\\t then I will let you know . The adjustments knobs have positive clicks and seem to track well .The IR light that is mounted on the scope is decent for about 75 to 100 yds and I think a added IR light would really light things up after looking at some videos, so I ordered one from here and am still waiting for it from China ...There is a great review on the 2.5 x 50 scope on youtube showing you what you will actually see when using the scope, you just have to put yukon scope in the search and it shows a dirt road with power poles . The image in the video does not do it Justis compared to actually looking through it in real life . The other scopes are set up for a locked in focus for the masses , this one lets you adjust for each individuals eyes . So people when asking yourself should I get this one or the cheaper one ???? think about this..... how many times have you gone through $150 with a tank of gas thats gone in less than a week with going to dinner and the movies added in ????..Them items are gone now but invested here will last for years and give you a great viewing experience every time you look through it instead of saying , I wish i could see a little farther and what is that over there ? ....I can tell you its a rabbit now for sure ...I hope this helps some of you in your decision.'
B001C74GM8|24189255818870|'5.0,It takes some getting used to but worked fine. Saw deer eating apples , they didn\t know we could see them. ( We weren\t after them, just watching) With the Armasight IR810 Detachable Long Range Infrared Illuminator the Gen 1 works great.'

B001C74GM8|28587302323145|'5.0,My second night scope.  First was in 2004 and did not compare to this one.I am planning on using it for night pellet rifle &#34;Ratting&#34; - look it up on youtube.  It works well for about 150 feet and even better with an IR flashlight.  Is adjustable for L/R and elevation.  You can turn the built in IR and crosshair on/off using the optional remote switch.I was playing with it around the neighborhood - not attached to anything, and you can see animals eyes reflect back at you.  I can\\t wait.  Definitely worth the purchase.  If you are going to use it for night time boar hunting, I am not sure you will have the magnification for distance as it is only a 1.5x , but for my purpose, it is perfect.'

B001C74GM8|1742|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing.. I wish it came in \"\"black\"\" but with that said.. the OD Green is better looking than the pictures. Once wrapped with ghillie.. it matters not. I actually thought I might been disappointed with this purchase. \"\"IF\"\" it remains working as it has at the start.. it was well worth the low cost.Note: Mine says 3 year warranty not lifetime.. which was one of the buying factors. Nor did I recieve a mail in warranty card in the box. I did fill one out at their website and will hang onto that information along with the receipt if needed in the future! They say warranty only good if you return it within the first 30 days. I wont take away a star for this because this scope still has me grining and owning the night as advertised.'"

B001C74GM8|6597069768965|'2.0,Got the NVRS in several weeks ago, bore sighted and laser sighted it in at the house at 60 yrds. Due to all the rain and snow didn\t get to the range until today. About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

It was reduced less than a day here so; I bought from B&H.PhotoVideo; online store instead. 389.99 W No Tax or Shipping. B&H; is awesome and I had it well packaged and within 2 days.Now, I have been a US Marine for 23 years. I am getting out of the game due to combat injuries, Left leg full of metal ect. I have used Uncle Sams\ NV platforms for years. NV Scopes on .50 Cal, Aviation Helmet NV Goggles for aviation ops ect. The latest Generation stuff available.I was very skeptical. I couldn\t afford 5, 10, 15 grand or more so I gave this a try. It had good reviews. Of course it\s not comparable to what I was provided by Gov. but I was pleasantly surprised. So far it\s well built. The night vision works. I have no black, dark or void spots whatsoever. I am extremely happy with this product, for the money.No regrets so far.I have taken it out and played with it. I bought it for my personal M4 platform in 5.56. I am still trying to figure if I am going to have to zero it at night or not. The reticle is red on a green field and reticle intensity is adjustable. This is not a scope I would want to use busting into a drug cartels compound but, in a civilian defensive mode it is a nice tool to have. For killing insurgent deer and wild boar and stuff, it should work nicely. Yea baby, eat more meat! Most of my shooting is precision shooting and practice. I may try to hunt pigs and coyotes at night if it\s legal. I need to check local laws on night hunting first.Something I noticed, When there is heavy brush or bush, trees and stuff up close, it tends to wash out the picture some. Only with the IR light on. Too much light reflecting. It\s easy to flip off the IR though and go into a more passive NV mode without Infrared Assist.After I zero it and shoot a few hundred rounds at night I will weigh in and give my opinion again. I hope this review helps someone else. Have fun, Be Safe, and Semper Fidelis! \"\"always faithful\"\"'"

It works well for about 150 feet and even better with an IR flashlight.  Is adjustable for L/R and elevation.  You can turn the built in IR and crosshair on/off using the optional remote switch.I was playing with it around the neighborhood - not attached to anything, and you can see animals eyes reflect back at you.  I can\\t wait.  Definitely worth the purchase.  If you are going to use it for night time boar hunting, I am not sure you will have the magnification for distance as it is only a 1.5x , but for my purpose, it is perfect.'

B001C74GM8|19791209300628|'5.0,I did my research before purchasing this scope. I read the few customer reviews here on Amazon and then hit google to find more reviews. I read every one I could find.One of my big requirements were that I wanted something that used AA or AAA batteries and this fit the bill.I do not have this mounted yet, so I\\ve been using it as a monocle. A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night. It was a clear evening so I assume there was a ton of ambient natural IR light, but I was amazed!So far this was money well spent, this thing is fantastic!This was only the first part of my test I\\ll update my review as time goes on.'

B001C74GM8|21990232558865|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing.. I wish it came in \"\"black\"\" but with that said.. the OD Green is better looking than the pictures. Once wrapped with ghillie.. it matters not. I actually thought I might been disappointed with this purchase. \"\"IF\"\" it remains working as it has at the start.. it was well worth the low cost.Note: Mine says 3 year warranty not lifetime.. which was one of the buying factors. Nor did I recieve a mail in warranty card in the box. I did fill one out at their website and will hang onto that information along with the receipt if needed in the future! They say warranty only good if you return it within the first 30 days. I wont take away a star for this because this scope still has me grining and owning the night as advertised.'"

I need to check local laws on night hunting first.Something I noticed, When there is heavy brush or bush, trees and stuff up close, it tends to wash out the picture some. Only with the IR light on. Too much light reflecting. It\s easy to flip off the IR though and go into a more passive NV mode without Infrared Assist.After I zero it and shoot a few hundred rounds at night I will weigh in and give my opinion again. I hope this review helps someone else. Have fun, Be Safe, and Semper Fidelis! \"\"always faithful\"\"'"

B001C74GM8|30786325584856|'5.0,My second night scope.  First was in 2004 and did not compare to this one.I am planning on using it for night pellet rifle &#34;Ratting&#34; - look it up on youtube.  It works well for about 150 feet and even better with an IR flashlight.  Is adjustable for L/R and elevation.  You can turn the built in IR and crosshair on/off using the optional remote switch.I was playing with it around the neighborhood - not attached to anything, and you can see animals eyes reflect back at you.  I can\\t wait.  Definitely worth the purchase.  If you are going to use it for night time boar hunting, I am not sure you will have the magnification for distance as it is only a 1.5x , but for my purpose, it is perfect.'

I read every one I could find.One of my big requirements were that I wanted something that used AA or AAA batteries and this fit the bill.I do not have this mounted yet, so I\\ve been using it as a monocle. A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night. It was a clear evening so I assume there was a ton of ambient natural IR light, but I was amazed!So far this was money well spent, this thing is fantastic!This was only the first part of my test I\\ll update my review as time goes on.'

I now can see what goes &#34;bump in the night&#34; without giving away my position with a flash light. My only real complaint is the color... its not that it is a ugly color green, its just it would look so much better if it matched my M4.  but comes off in seconds to switch out with a red dot or something else.  It def looks like a thousand dollar scope, though. Also, the weight in not bad on the rifle,  what the hell... you can see in the dark.  Just be carful of your eye... the first night I had it I was walking my property for about a half hour because it was so cool, but when I came back indoors my eye was cloudy for 10 mins or so. lol  but all in all, its Bad Ass!'

B001C74GM8|10710|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing.. I wish it came in \"\"black\"\" but with that said.. the OD Green is better looking than the pictures. Once wrapped with ghillie.. it matters not. I actually thought I might been disappointed with this purchase. \"\"IF\"\" it remains working as it has at the start.. it was well worth the low cost.Note: Mine says 3 year warranty not lifetime.. which was one of the buying factors. Nor did I recieve a mail in warranty card in the box. I did fill one out at their website and will hang onto that information along with the receipt if needed in the future! They say warranty only good if you return it within the first 30 days. I wont take away a star for this because this scope still has me grining and owning the night as advertised.'"
B001C74GM8|2199023261026|'2.0,Got the NVRS in several weeks ago, bore sighted and laser sighted it in at the house at 60 yrds. Due to all the rain and snow didn\t get to the range until today. About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

I read every one I could find.One of my big requirements were that I wanted something that used AA or AAA batteries and this fit the bill.I do not have this mounted yet, so I\\ve been using it as a monocle. A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night. It was a clear evening so I assume there was a ton of ambient natural IR light, but I was amazed!So far this was money well spent, this thing is fantastic!This was only the first part of my test I\\ll update my review as time goes on.'
B001C74GM8|30786325582647|'5.0,My second night scope.  First was in 2004 and did not compare to this one.I am planning on using it for night pellet rifle &#34;Ratting&#34; - look it up on youtube.  It works well for about 150 feet and even better with an IR flashlight.  Is adjustable for L/R and elevation.  You can turn the built in IR and crosshair on/off using the optional remote switch.I was playing with it around the neighborhood - not attached to anything, and you can see animals eyes reflect back at you.  I can\\t wait.  Definitely worth the purchase.  If you are going to use it for night time boar hunting, I am not sure you will have the magnification for distance as it is only a 1.5x , but for my purpose, it is perfect.'
B001C74GM8|30786325588391|'1.0,I have had 4 of these scopes the first being ordered in Oct 2012 - ALL 4 have failed - the first would not power up - the second the cross hairs started &#34;walking&#34; on the range while trying to zero - the third also failed to power up and the forth failed on the first shot at the range - AR 15 platform - shooting XM193 55gr 5.56mm for 50 then to 100 yard range - never got to make a 100 yard shot and followed directions exactly - I believe you are much more likely to get one that fails to operate than you are one that functions as advertised - trying to get a monetary refund as of this writing'
B001C74GM8|32985348835666|'5.0,It takes some getting used to but worked fine. Saw deer eating apples , they didn\t know we could see them. ( We weren\t after them, just watching) With the Armasight IR810 Detachable Long Range Infrared Illuminator the Gen 1 works great.'
B001C74GM8|32985348843209|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing.. I wish it came in \"\"black\"\" but with that said.. the OD Green is better looking than the pictures. Once wrapped with ghillie.. it matters not. I actually thought I might been disappointed with this purchase. \"\"IF\"\" it remains working as it has at the start.. it was well worth the low cost.Note: Mine says 3 year warranty not lifetime.. which was one of the buying factors. Nor did I recieve a mail in warranty card in the box. I did fill one out at their website and will hang onto that information along with the receipt if needed in the future! They say warranty only good if you return it within the first 30 days. I wont take away a star for this because this scope still has me grining and owning the night as advertised.'"

B001C74GM8|2199023263732|'2.0,Got the NVRS in several weeks ago, bore sighted and laser sighted it in at the house at 60 yrds. Due to all the rain and snow didn\t get to the range until today. About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

B001C74GM8|8796093023416|"'5.0,OK, I had this in my Amazon Basket. The price dropped to 389.99 W No Tax or Shipping. As I was inpro the price jumped back to 399.99. It was reduced less than a day here so; I bought from B&H.PhotoVideo; online store instead. 389.99 W No Tax or Shipping. B&H; is awesome and I had it well packaged and within 2 days.Now, I have been a US Marine for 23 years. I am getting out of the game due to combat injuries, Left leg full of metal ect. I have used Uncle Sams\ NV platforms for years. NV Scopes on .50 Cal, Aviation Helmet NV Goggles for aviation ops ect. The latest Generation stuff available.I was very skeptical. I couldn\t afford 5, 10, 15 grand or more so I gave this a try. It had good reviews. Of course it\s not comparable to what I was provided by Gov. but I was pleasantly surprised. So far it\s well built. The night vision works. I have no black, dark or void spots whatsoever. I am extremely happy with this product, for the money.No regrets so far.I have taken it out and played with it. I bought it for my personal M4 platform in 5.56. I am still trying to figure if I am going to have to zero it at night or not. The reticle is red on a green field and reticle intensity is adjustable. This is not a scope I would want to use busting into a drug cartels compound but, in a civilian defensive mode it is a nice tool to have. For killing insurgent deer and wild boar and stuff, it should work nicely. Yea baby, eat more meat! Most of my shooting is precision shooting and practice. I may try to hunt pigs and coyotes at night if it\s legal. I need to check local laws on night hunting first.Something I noticed, When there is heavy brush or bush, trees and stuff up close, it tends to wash out the picture some. Only with the IR light on. Too much light reflecting. It\s easy to flip off the IR though and go into a more passive NV mode without Infrared Assist.After I zero it and shoot a few hundred rounds at night I will weigh in and give my opinion again. I hope this review helps someone else. Have fun, Be Safe, and Semper Fidelis! \"\"always faithful\"\"'"

B001C74GM8|8796093029150|'4.0,I had two of the 1.5 x 42 yukon scopes and they are ok if you know what to expect out of a gen 1 tube and $400 also if you can get past the ugly green that is different colors in different spots (why not black guys?) . The problem was that besides the normal fish eye effect that is common with gen 1 scopes , it was lacking in the focusing department . Yes it had the back ring but that really is just for the cross hairs to clear up and not be doubled while looking at them . I could see some what clearly with the cover down at very short range inside the house ( like 10 feet ) when you opened the cover it was a total blur . Outside I would really have to fight the double cross hair problem when looking at something specific ,I do not wear glasses nor need them... I saw a rabbit one time at about 30 yds and knew it was a rabbit but I really could not identify it clearly . Deer or hog size game you can see but you are limited to under 100 yds trust me 75 should be the limit really . I searched for a scope that could clear things up and be reasonable . I searched for days and just got sick of hunting for one that wasn\\t $1500 or more . I also learned through my research that Sightmark owns every company I was looking at ( yukon , pulsar and one other company its not ATN ) also that listings of gen 1+ and 2 gen + means nothing other then current production tubes . The life time warranty is only for 3 years on yukon and sightmark scopes tubes which is better than any other company . I heard too many hit and misses with ATN products and decided to avoid them . I looked at this scope Yukon Nvrs Tactical 2.5X50 with Internal Focusing Night Vision Rifle scope,and saw it had an adjustable objective ring in addition to the rear ring adjustment for $150 more..and it also has is a weaver rail on the other side (not shown) to mount an IR light or laser that the 1.5 does not have and its BLACK!!!! way better looking . I took it out at night with 3/4 moon and minimum cloud cover....OMG it is totally worth the extra $150 looking at the same places that I did with the two other 1.5 x 42 scopes. It was the difference between being ok with a product or totally satisfied and happy .The 1.5 x 42 only gives you a small center that is useful... the outer edges are of no use and that is a known issue with gen 1 so I understood . This scope maybe due to the focusing objective ring may have helped in correcting the problem a little because I have much better edge to edge clarity . Now when I look at something that might be blurred I just roll the front ring and its clear as can be. My cross hairs are on point after a turn with the rear ring .The person that stated he could not get it sighted in through the pin hole ..well your not suppose to do it that way, it even tells you in the instructions to do it at night with the cover up. I have not sighted it in yet but the others were done that way with no problems and if this one don\\t then I will let you know . The adjustments knobs have positive clicks and seem to track well .The IR light that is mounted on the scope is decent for about 75 to 100 yds and I think a added IR light would really light things up after looking at some videos, so I ordered one from here and am still waiting for it from China ...There is a great review on the 2.5 x 50 scope on youtube showing you what you will actually see when using the scope, you just have to put yukon scope in the search and it shows a dirt road with power poles . The image in the video does not do it Justis compared to actually looking through it in real life . The other scopes are set up for a locked in focus for the masses , this one lets you adjust for each individuals eyes . So people when asking yourself should I get this one or the cheaper one ???? think about this..... how many times have you gone through $150 with a tank of gas thats gone in less than a week with going to dinner and the movies added in ????..Them items are gone now but invested here will last for years and give you a great viewing experience every time you look through it instead of saying , I wish i could see a little farther and what is that over there ? ....I can tell you its a rabbit now for sure ...I hope this helps some of you in your decision.'

B001C74GM8|21990232558552|'5.0,I did my research before purchasing this scope. I read the few customer reviews here on Amazon and then hit google to find more reviews. I read every one I could find.One of my big requirements were that I wanted something that used AA or AAA batteries and this fit the bill.I do not have this mounted yet, so I\\ve been using it as a monocle. A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night. It was a clear evening so I assume there was a ton of ambient natural IR light, but I was amazed!So far this was money well spent, this thing is fantastic!This was only the first part of my test I\\ll update my review as time goes on.'

About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after.

B001C74GM8|28587302327258|'1.0,I have had 4 of these scopes the first being ordered in Oct 2012 - ALL 4 have failed - the first would not power up - the second the cross hairs started &#34;walking&#34; on the range while trying to zero - the third also failed to power up and the forth failed on the first shot at the range - AR 15 platform - shooting XM193 55gr 5.56mm for 50 then to 100 yard range - never got to make a 100 yard shot and followed directions exactly - I believe you are much more likely to get one that fails to operate than you are one that functions as advertised - trying to get a monetary refund as of this writing'
B001C74GM8|28587302329179|'5.0,My second night scope.  First was in 2004 and did not compare to this one.I am planning on using it for night pellet rifle &#34;Ratting&#34; - look it up on youtube.  It works well for about 150 feet and even better with an IR flashlight.  Is adjustable for L/R and elevation.  You can turn the built in IR and crosshair on/off using the optional remote switch.I was playing with it around the neighborhood - not attached to anything, and you can see animals eyes reflect back at you.  I can\\t wait.  Definitely worth the purchase.  If you are going to use it for night time boar hunting, I am not sure you will have the magnification for distance as it is only a 1.5x , but for my purpose, it is perfect.'

B001C74GM8|6597069772886|'4.0,I had two of the 1.5 x 42 yukon scopes and they are ok if you know what to expect out of a gen 1 tube and $400 also if you can get past the ugly green that is different colors in different spots (why not black guys?) . The problem was that besides the normal fish eye effect that is common with gen 1 scopes , it was lacking in the focusing department . Yes it had the back ring but that really is just for the cross hairs to clear up and not be doubled while looking at them . I could see some what clearly with the cover down at very short range inside the house ( like 10 feet ) when you opened the cover it was a total blur . Outside I would really have to fight the double cross hair problem when looking at something specific ,I do not wear glasses nor need them... I saw a rabbit one time at about 30 yds and knew it was a rabbit but I really could not identify it clearly . Deer or hog size game you can see but you are limited to under 100 yds trust me 75 should be the limit really . I searched for a scope that could clear things up and be reasonable . I searched for days and just got sick of hunting for one that wasn\\t $1500 or more . I also learned through my research that Sightmark owns every company I was looking at ( yukon , pulsar and one other company its not ATN ) also that listings of gen 1+ and 2 gen + means nothing other then current production tubes . The life time warranty is only for 3 years on yukon and sightmark scopes tubes which is better than any other company . I heard too many hit and misses with ATN products and decided to avoid them . I looked at this scope Yukon Nvrs Tactical 2.5X50 with Internal Focusing Night Vision Rifle scope,and saw it had an adjustable objective ring in addition to the rear ring adjustment for $150 more..and it also has is a weaver rail on the other side (not shown) to mount an IR light or laser that the 1.5 does not have and its BLACK!!!! way better looking . I took it out at night with 3/4 moon and minimum cloud cover....OMG it is totally worth the extra $150 looking at the same places that I did with the two other 1.5 x 42 scopes. It was the difference between being ok with a product or totally satisfied and happy .The 1.5 x 42 only gives you a small center that is useful... the outer edges are of no use and that is a known issue with gen 1 so I understood . This scope maybe due to the focusing objective ring may have helped in correcting the problem a little because I have much better edge to edge clarity . Now when I look at something that might be blurred I just roll the front ring and its clear as can be. My cross hairs are on point after a turn with the rear ring .The person that stated he could not get it sighted in through the pin hole ..well your not suppose to do it that way, it even tells you in the instructions to do it at night with the cover up. I have not sighted it in yet but the others were done that way with no problems and if this one don\\t then I will let you know . The adjustments knobs have positive clicks and seem to track well .The IR light that is mounted on the scope is decent for about 75 to 100 yds and I think a added IR light would really light things up after looking at some videos, so I ordered one from here and am still waiting for it from China ...There is a great review on the 2.5 x 50 scope on youtube showing you what you will actually see when using the scope, you just have to put yukon scope in the search and it shows a dirt road with power poles . The image in the video does not do it Justis compared to actually looking through it in real life . The other scopes are set up for a locked in focus for the masses , this one lets you adjust for each individuals eyes . So people when asking yourself should I get this one or the cheaper one ???? think about this..... how many times have you gone through $150 with a tank of gas thats gone in less than a week with going to dinner and the movies added in ????..Them items are gone now but invested here will last for years and give you a great viewing experience every time you look through it instead of saying , I wish i could see a little farther and what is that over there ? ....I can tell you its a rabbit now for sure ...I hope this helps some of you in your decision.'

I read every one I could find.One of my big requirements were that I wanted something that used AA or AAA batteries and this fit the bill.I do not have this mounted yet, so I\\ve been using it as a monocle. A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night. It was a clear evening so I assume there was a ton of ambient natural IR light, but I was amazed!So far this was money well spent, this thing is fantastic!This was only the first part of my test I\\ll update my review as time goes on.'
B001C74GM8|10995116286734|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing.. I wish it came in \"\"black\"\" but with that said.. the OD Green is better looking than the pictures. Once wrapped with ghillie.. it matters not. I actually thought I might been disappointed with this purchase. \"\"IF\"\" it remains working as it has at the start.. it was well worth the low cost.Note: Mine says 3 year warranty not lifetime.. which was one of the buying factors. Nor did I recieve a mail in warranty card in the box. I did fill one out at their website and will hang onto that information along with the receipt if needed in the future! They say warranty only good if you return it within the first 30 days. I wont take away a star for this because this scope still has me grining and owning the night as advertised.'"

B001C74GM8|13194139539264|'5.0,It is what it is...  for the money it is exactly what you paid for.  Unless you have a buddy who has a better Night Vision scope... you will think its Awesome.  I now can see what goes &#34;bump in the night&#34; without giving away my position with a flash light. My only real complaint is the color... its not that it is a ugly color green, its just it would look so much better if it matched my M4.  but comes off in seconds to switch out with a red dot or something else.  It def looks like a thousand dollar scope, though. Also, the weight in not bad on the rifle,  what the hell... you can see in the dark.  Just be carful of your eye... the first night I had it I was walking my property for about a half hour because it was so cool, but when I came back indoors my eye was cloudy for 10 mins or so. lol  but all in all, its Bad Ass!'

It was reduced less than a day here so; I bought from B&H.PhotoVideo; online store instead. 389.99 W No Tax or Shipping. B&H; is awesome and I had it well packaged and within 2 days.Now, I have been a US Marine for 23 years. I am getting out of the game due to combat injuries, Left leg full of metal ect. I have used Uncle Sams\ NV platforms for years. NV Scopes on .50 Cal, Aviation Helmet NV Goggles for aviation ops ect. The latest Generation stuff available.I was very skeptical. I couldn\t afford 5, 10, 15 grand or more so I gave this a try. It had good reviews. Of course it\s not comparable to what I was provided by Gov. but I was pleasantly surprised. So far it\s well built. The night vision works. I have no black, dark or void spots whatsoever. I am extremely happy with this product, for the money.No regrets so far.I have taken it out and played with it. I bought it for my personal M4 platform in 5.56. I am still trying to figure if I am going to have to zero it at night or not. The reticle is red on a green field and reticle intensity is adjustable. This is not a scope I would want to use busting into a drug cartels compound but, in a civilian defensive mode it is a nice tool to have. For killing insurgent deer and wild boar and stuff, it should work nicely. Yea baby, eat more meat! Most of my shooting is precision shooting and practice. I may try to hunt pigs and coyotes at night if it\s legal. I need to check local laws on night hunting first.Something I noticed, When there is heavy brush or bush, trees and stuff up close, it tends to wash out the picture some. Only with the IR light on. Too much light reflecting. It\s easy to flip off the IR though and go into a more passive NV mode without Infrared Assist.After I zero it and shoot a few hundred rounds at night I will weigh in and give my opinion again.

B001C74GM8|4398046514861|'2.0,Got the NVRS in several weeks ago, bore sighted and laser sighted it in at the house at 60 yrds. Due to all the rain and snow didn\t get to the range until today. About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

B001C74GM8|8796093023047|'4.0,I had two of the 1.5 x 42 yukon scopes and they are ok if you know what to expect out of a gen 1 tube and $400 also if you can get past the ugly green that is different colors in different spots (why not black guys?) . The problem was that besides the normal fish eye effect that is common with gen 1 scopes , it was lacking in the focusing department . Yes it had the back ring but that really is just for the cross hairs to clear up and not be doubled while looking at them . I could see some what clearly with the cover down at very short range inside the house ( like 10 feet ) when you opened the cover it was a total blur . Outside I would really have to fight the double cross hair problem when looking at something specific ,I do not wear glasses nor need them... I saw a rabbit one time at about 30 yds and knew it was a rabbit but I really could not identify it clearly . Deer or hog size game you can see but you are limited to under 100 yds trust me 75 should be the limit really . I searched for a scope that could clear things up and be reasonable . I searched for days and just got sick of hunting for one that wasn\\t $1500 or more . I also learned through my research that Sightmark owns every company I was looking at ( yukon , pulsar and one other company its not ATN ) also that listings of gen 1+ and 2 gen + means nothing other then current production tubes . The life time warranty is only for 3 years on yukon and sightmark scopes tubes which is better than any other company . I heard too many hit and misses with ATN products and decided to avoid them . I looked at this scope Yukon Nvrs Tactical 2.5X50 with Internal Focusing Night Vision Rifle scope,and saw it had an adjustable objective ring in addition to the rear ring adjustment for $150 more..and it also has is a weaver rail on the other side (not shown) to mount an IR light or laser that the 1.5 does not have and its BLACK!!!! way better looking . I took it out at night with 3/4 moon and minimum cloud cover....OMG it is totally worth the extra $150 looking at the same places that I did with the two other 1.5 x 42 scopes. It was the difference between being ok with a product or totally satisfied and happy .The 1.5 x 42 only gives you a small center that is useful... the outer edges are of no use and that is a known issue with gen 1 so I understood . This scope maybe due to the focusing objective ring may have helped in correcting the problem a little because I have much better edge to edge clarity . Now when I look at something that might be blurred I just roll the front ring and its clear as can be. My cross hairs are on point after a turn with the rear ring .The person that stated he could not get it sighted in through the pin hole ..well your not suppose to do it that way, it even tells you in the instructions to do it at night with the cover up. I have not sighted it in yet but the others were done that way with no problems and if this one don\\t then I will let you know . The adjustments knobs have positive clicks and seem to track well .The IR light that is mounted on the scope is decent for about 75 to 100 yds and I think a added IR light would really light things up after looking at some videos, so I ordered one from here and am still waiting for it from China ...There is a great review on the 2.5 x 50 scope on youtube showing you what you will actually see when using the scope, you just have to put yukon scope in the search and it shows a dirt road with power poles . The image in the video does not do it Justis compared to actually looking through it in real life . The other scopes are set up for a locked in focus for the masses , this one lets you adjust for each individuals eyes . So people when asking yourself should I get this one or the cheaper one ???? think about this..... how many times have you gone through $150 with a tank of gas thats gone in less than a week with going to dinner and the movies added in ????..Them items are gone now but invested here will last for years and give you a great viewing experience every time you look through it instead of saying , I wish i could see a little farther and what is that over there ? ....I can tell you its a rabbit now for sure ...I hope this helps some of you in your decision.'

B001C74GM8|8796093031534|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing.. I wish it came in \"\"black\"\" but with that said.. the OD Green is better looking than the pictures. Once wrapped with ghillie.. it matters not. I actually thought I might been disappointed with this purchase. \"\"IF\"\" it remains working as it has at the start.. it was well worth the low cost.Note: Mine says 3 year warranty not lifetime.. which was one of the buying factors. Nor did I recieve a mail in warranty card in the box. I did fill one out at their website and will hang onto that information along with the receipt if needed in the future! They say warranty only good if you return it within the first 30 days. I wont take away a star for this because this scope still has me grining and owning the night as advertised.'"

I now can see what goes &#34;bump in the night&#34; without giving away my position with a flash light. My only real complaint is the color... its not that it is a ugly color green, its just it would look so much better if it matched my M4.  but comes off in seconds to switch out with a red dot or something else.  It def looks like a thousand dollar scope, though. Also, the weight in not bad on the rifle,  what the hell... you can see in the dark.  Just be carful of your eye... the first night I had it I was walking my property for about a half hour because it was so cool, but when I came back indoors my eye was cloudy for 10 mins or so. lol  but all in all, its Bad Ass!'

I can\\t wait.  Definitely worth the purchase.  If you are going to use it for night time boar hunting, I am not sure you will have the magnification for distance as it is only a 1.5x , but for my purpose, it is perfect.'

I now can see what goes &#34;bump in the night&#34; without giving away my position with a flash light. My only real complaint is the color... its not that it is a ugly color green, its just it would look so much better if it matched my M4.  but comes off in seconds to switch out with a red dot or something else.  It def looks like a thousand dollar scope, though. Also, the weight in not bad on the rifle,  what the hell... you can see in the dark.

B001C74GM8|30786325588058|'4.0,I had two of the 1.5 x 42 yukon scopes and they are ok if you know what to expect out of a gen 1 tube and $400 also if you can get past the ugly green that is different colors in different spots (why not black guys?) . The problem was that besides the normal fish eye effect that is common with gen 1 scopes , it was lacking in the focusing department . Yes it had the back ring but that really is just for the cross hairs to clear up and not be doubled while looking at them . I could see some what clearly with the cover down at very short range inside the house ( like 10 feet ) when you opened the cover it was a total blur . Outside I would really have to fight the double cross hair problem when looking at something specific ,I do not wear glasses nor need them... I saw a rabbit one time at about 30 yds and knew it was a rabbit but I really could not identify it clearly . Deer or hog size game you can see but you are limited to under 100 yds trust me 75 should be the limit really . I searched for a scope that could clear things up and be reasonable . I searched for days and just got sick of hunting for one that wasn\\t $1500 or more . I also learned through my research that Sightmark owns every company I was looking at ( yukon , pulsar and one other company its not ATN ) also that listings of gen 1+ and 2 gen + means nothing other then current production tubes . The life time warranty is only for 3 years on yukon and sightmark scopes tubes which is better than any other company . I heard too many hit and misses with ATN products and decided to avoid them . I looked at this scope Yukon Nvrs Tactical 2.5X50 with Internal Focusing Night Vision Rifle scope,and saw it had an adjustable objective ring in addition to the rear ring adjustment for $150 more..and it also has is a weaver rail on the other side (not shown) to mount an IR light or laser that the 1.5 does not have and its BLACK!!!! way better looking . I took it out at night with 3/4 moon and minimum cloud cover....OMG it is totally worth the extra $150 looking at the same places that I did with the two other 1.5 x 42 scopes. It was the difference between being ok with a product or totally satisfied and happy .The 1.5 x 42 only gives you a small center that is useful... the outer edges are of no use and that is a known issue with gen 1 so I understood . This scope maybe due to the focusing objective ring may have helped in correcting the problem a little because I have much better edge to edge clarity . Now when I look at something that might be blurred I just roll the front ring and its clear as can be. My cross hairs are on point after a turn with the rear ring .The person that stated he could not get it sighted in through the pin hole ..well your not suppose to do it that way, it even tells you in the instructions to do it at night with the cover up. I have not sighted it in yet but the others were done that way with no problems and if this one don\\t then I will let you know . The adjustments knobs have positive clicks and seem to track well .The IR light that is mounted on the scope is decent for about 75 to 100 yds and I think a added IR light would really light things up after looking at some videos, so I ordered one from here and am still waiting for it from China ...There is a great review on the 2.5 x 50 scope on youtube showing you what you will actually see when using the scope, you just have to put yukon scope in the search and it shows a dirt road with power poles . The image in the video does not do it Justis compared to actually looking through it in real life . The other scopes are set up for a locked in focus for the masses , this one lets you adjust for each individuals eyes . So people when asking yourself should I get this one or the cheaper one ???? think about this..... how many times have you gone through $150 with a tank of gas thats gone in less than a week with going to dinner and the movies added in ????..Them items are gone now but invested here will last for years and give you a great viewing experience every time you look through it instead of saying , I wish i could see a little farther and what is that over there ? ....I can tell you its a rabbit now for sure ...I hope this helps some of you in your decision.'

About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

You can turn the built in IR and crosshair on/off using the optional remote switch.I was playing with it around the neighborhood - not attached to anything, and you can see animals eyes reflect back at you.  I can\\t wait.  Definitely worth the purchase.  If you are going to use it for night time boar hunting, I am not sure you will have the magnification for distance as it is only a 1.5x , but for my purpose, it is perfect.'

I now can see what goes &#34;bump in the night&#34; without giving away my position with a flash light. My only real complaint is the color... its not that it is a ugly color green, its just it would look so much better if it matched my M4.  but comes off in seconds to switch out with a red dot or something else.  It def looks like a thousand dollar scope, though. Also, the weight in not bad on the rifle,  what the hell... you can see in the dark.  Just be carful of your eye... the first night I had it I was walking my property for about a half hour because it was so cool, but when I came back indoors my eye was cloudy for 10 mins or so. lol  but all in all, its Bad Ass!'

I couldn\t afford 5, 10, 15 grand or more so I gave this a try. It had good reviews. Of course it\s not comparable to what I was provided by Gov. but I was pleasantly surprised. So far it\s well built. The night vision works. I have no black, dark or void spots whatsoever. I am extremely happy with this product, for the money.No regrets so far.I have taken it out and played with it. I bought it for my personal M4 platform in 5.56. I am still trying to figure if I am going to have to zero it at night or not. The reticle is red on a green field and reticle intensity is adjustable. This is not a scope I would want to use busting into a drug cartels compound but, in a civilian defensive mode it is a nice tool to have. For killing insurgent deer and wild boar and stuff, it should work nicely. Yea baby, eat more meat! Most of my shooting is precision shooting and practice. I may try to hunt pigs and coyotes at night if it\s legal. I need to check local laws on night hunting first.Something I noticed, When there is heavy brush or bush, trees and stuff up close, it tends to wash out the picture some. Only with the IR light on. Too much light reflecting. It\s easy to flip off the IR though and go into a more passive NV mode without Infrared Assist.After I zero it and shoot a few hundred rounds at night I will weigh in and give my opinion again.

B001C74GM8|17592186048458|'5.0,I did my research before purchasing this scope. I read the few customer reviews here on Amazon and then hit google to find more reviews. I read every one I could find.One of my big requirements were that I wanted something that used AA or AAA batteries and this fit the bill.I do not have this mounted yet, so I\\ve been using it as a monocle. A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night. It was a clear evening so I assume there was a ton of ambient natural IR light, but I was amazed!So far this was money well spent, this thing is fantastic!This was only the first part of my test I\\ll update my review as time goes on.'

B001C74GM8|21990232561173|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing.. I wish it came in \"\"black\"\" but with that said.. the OD Green is better looking than the pictures. Once wrapped with ghillie.. it matters not. I actually thought I might been disappointed with this purchase. \"\"IF\"\" it remains working as it has at the start.. it was well worth the low cost.Note: Mine says 3 year warranty not lifetime.. which was one of the buying factors. Nor did I recieve a mail in warranty card in the box. I did fill one out at their website and will hang onto that information along with the receipt if needed in the future! They say warranty only good if you return it within the first 30 days. I wont take away a star for this because this scope still has me grining and owning the night as advertised.'"

B001C74GM8|30786325578249|'2.0,Got the NVRS in several weeks ago, bore sighted and laser sighted it in at the house at 60 yrds. Due to all the rain and snow didn\t get to the range until today. About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

Just be carful of your eye... the first night I had it I was walking my property for about a half hour because it was so cool, but when I came back indoors my eye was cloudy for 10 mins or so. lol  but all in all, its Bad Ass!'
B001C74GM8|2351|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity.

I wish it came in \"\"black\"\" but with that said.. the OD Green is better looking than the pictures. Once wrapped with ghillie.. it matters not. I actually thought I might been disappointed with this purchase. \"\"IF\"\" it remains working as it has at the start.. it was well worth the low cost.Note: Mine says 3 year warranty not lifetime.. which was one of the buying factors. Nor did I recieve a mail in warranty card in the box. I did fill one out at their website and will hang onto that information along with the receipt if needed in the future! They say warranty only good if you return it within the first 30 days. I wont take away a star for this because this scope still has me grining and owning the night as advertised.'"
B001C74GM8|2868|'4.0,I had two of the 1.5 x 42 yukon scopes and they are ok if you know what to expect out of a gen 1 tube and $400 also if you can get past the ugly green that is different colors in different spots (why not black guys?) . The problem was that besides the normal fish eye effect that is common with gen 1 scopes , it was lacking in the focusing department . Yes it had the back ring but that really is just for the cross hairs to clear up and not be doubled while looking at them . I could see some what clearly with the cover down at very short range inside the house ( like 10 feet ) when you opened the cover it was a total blur . Outside I would really have to fight the double cross hair problem when looking at something specific ,I do not wear glasses nor need them... I saw a rabbit one time at about 30 yds and knew it was a rabbit but I really could not identify it clearly . Deer or hog size game you can see but you are limited to under 100 yds trust me 75 should be the limit really . I searched for a scope that could clear things up and be reasonable . I searched for days and just got sick of hunting for one that wasn\\t $1500 or more . I also learned through my research that Sightmark owns every company I was looking at ( yukon , pulsar and one other company its not ATN ) also that listings of gen 1+ and 2 gen + means nothing other then current production tubes . The life time warranty is only for 3 years on yukon and sightmark scopes tubes which is better than any other company . I heard too many hit and misses with ATN products and decided to avoid them . I looked at this scope Yukon Nvrs Tactical 2.5X50 with Internal Focusing Night Vision Rifle scope,and saw it had an adjustable objective ring in addition to the rear ring adjustment for $150 more..and it also has is a weaver rail on the other side (not shown) to mount an IR light or laser that the 1.5 does not have and its BLACK!!!! way better looking . I took it out at night with 3/4 moon and minimum cloud cover....OMG it is totally worth the extra $150 looking at the same places that I did with the two other 1.5 x 42 scopes. It was the difference between being ok with a product or totally satisfied and happy .The 1.5 x 42 only gives you a small center that is useful... the outer edges are of no use and that is a known issue with gen 1 so I understood . This scope maybe due to the focusing objective ring may have helped in correcting the problem a little because I have much better edge to edge clarity . Now when I look at something that might be blurred I just roll the front ring and its clear as can be. My cross hairs are on point after a turn with the rear ring .The person that stated he could not get it sighted in through the pin hole ..well your not suppose to do it that way, it even tells you in the instructions to do it at night with the cover up. I have not sighted it in yet but the others were done that way with no problems and if this one don\\t then I will let you know . The adjustments knobs have positive clicks and seem to track well .The IR light that is mounted on the scope is decent for about 75 to 100 yds and I think a added IR light would really light things up after looking at some videos, so I ordered one from here and am still waiting for it from China ...There is a great review on the 2.5 x 50 scope on youtube showing you what you will actually see when using the scope, you just have to put yukon scope in the search and it shows a dirt road with power poles . The image in the video does not do it Justis compared to actually looking through it in real life . The other scopes are set up for a locked in focus for the masses , this one lets you adjust for each individuals eyes . So people when asking yourself should I get this one or the cheaper one ???? think about this..... how many times have you gone through $150 with a tank of gas thats gone in less than a week with going to dinner and the movies added in ????..Them items are gone now but invested here will last for years and give you a great viewing experience every time you look through it instead of saying , I wish i could see a little farther and what is that over there ? ....I can tell you its a rabbit now for sure ...I hope this helps some of you in your decision.'

I couldn\t afford 5, 10, 15 grand or more so I gave this a try. It had good reviews. Of course it\s not comparable to what I was provided by Gov. but I was pleasantly surprised. So far it\s well built. The night vision works. I have no black, dark or void spots whatsoever. I am extremely happy with this product, for the money.No regrets so far.I have taken it out and played with it. I bought it for my personal M4 platform in 5.56. I am still trying to figure if I am going to have to zero it at night or not. The reticle is red on a green field and reticle intensity is adjustable. This is not a scope I would want to use busting into a drug cartels compound but, in a civilian defensive mode it is a nice tool to have. For killing insurgent deer and wild boar and stuff, it should work nicely. Yea baby, eat more meat! Most of my shooting is precision shooting and practice. I may try to hunt pigs and coyotes at night if it\s legal. I need to check local laws on night hunting first.Something I noticed, When there is heavy brush or bush, trees and stuff up close, it tends to wash out the picture some. Only with the IR light on. Too much light reflecting. It\s easy to flip off the IR though and go into a more passive NV mode without Infrared Assist.After I zero it and shoot a few hundred rounds at night I will weigh in and give my opinion again.

B001C74GM8|13194139533415|'5.0,I did my research before purchasing this scope. I read the few customer reviews here on Amazon and then hit google to find more reviews. I read every one I could find.One of my big requirements were that I wanted something that used AA or AAA batteries and this fit the bill.I do not have this mounted yet, so I\\ve been using it as a monocle. A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night. It was a clear evening so I assume there was a ton of ambient natural IR light, but I was amazed!So far this was money well spent, this thing is fantastic!This was only the first part of my test I\\ll update my review as time goes on.'

B001C74GM8|21990232556075|'2.0,Got the NVRS in several weeks ago, bore sighted and laser sighted it in at the house at 60 yrds. Due to all the rain and snow didn\t get to the range until today. About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

It works well for about 150 feet and even better with an IR flashlight.  Is adjustable for L/R and elevation.  You can turn the built in IR and crosshair on/off using the optional remote switch.I was playing with it around the neighborhood - not attached to anything, and you can see animals eyes reflect back at you.  I can\\t wait.  Definitely worth the purchase.  If you are going to use it for night time boar hunting, I am not sure you will have the magnification for distance as it is only a 1.5x , but for my purpose, it is perfect.'

B001C74GM8|32985348838410|'4.0,I had two of the 1.5 x 42 yukon scopes and they are ok if you know what to expect out of a gen 1 tube and $400 also if you can get past the ugly green that is different colors in different spots (why not black guys?) . The problem was that besides the normal fish eye effect that is common with gen 1 scopes , it was lacking in the focusing department . Yes it had the back ring but that really is just for the cross hairs to clear up and not be doubled while looking at them . I could see some what clearly with the cover down at very short range inside the house ( like 10 feet ) when you opened the cover it was a total blur . Outside I would really have to fight the double cross hair problem when looking at something specific ,I do not wear glasses nor need them... I saw a rabbit one time at about 30 yds and knew it was a rabbit but I really could not identify it clearly . Deer or hog size game you can see but you are limited to under 100 yds trust me 75 should be the limit really . I searched for a scope that could clear things up and be reasonable . I searched for days and just got sick of hunting for one that wasn\\t $1500 or more . I also learned through my research that Sightmark owns every company I was looking at ( yukon , pulsar and one other company its not ATN ) also that listings of gen 1+ and 2 gen + means nothing other then current production tubes . The life time warranty is only for 3 years on yukon and sightmark scopes tubes which is better than any other company . I heard too many hit and misses with ATN products and decided to avoid them . I looked at this scope Yukon Nvrs Tactical 2.5X50 with Internal Focusing Night Vision Rifle scope,and saw it had an adjustable objective ring in addition to the rear ring adjustment for $150 more..and it also has is a weaver rail on the other side (not shown) to mount an IR light or laser that the 1.5 does not have and its BLACK!!!! way better looking . I took it out at night with 3/4 moon and minimum cloud cover....OMG it is totally worth the extra $150 looking at the same places that I did with the two other 1.5 x 42 scopes. It was the difference between being ok with a product or totally satisfied and happy .The 1.5 x 42 only gives you a small center that is useful... the outer edges are of no use and that is a known issue with gen 1 so I understood . This scope maybe due to the focusing objective ring may have helped in correcting the problem a little because I have much better edge to edge clarity . Now when I look at something that might be blurred I just roll the front ring and its clear as can be. My cross hairs are on point after a turn with the rear ring .The person that stated he could not get it sighted in through the pin hole ..well your not suppose to do it that way, it even tells you in the instructions to do it at night with the cover up. I have not sighted it in yet but the others were done that way with no problems and if this one don\\t then I will let you know . The adjustments knobs have positive clicks and seem to track well .The IR light that is mounted on the scope is decent for about 75 to 100 yds and I think a added IR light would really light things up after looking at some videos, so I ordered one from here and am still waiting for it from China ...There is a great review on the 2.5 x 50 scope on youtube showing you what you will actually see when using the scope, you just have to put yukon scope in the search and it shows a dirt road with power poles . The image in the video does not do it Justis compared to actually looking through it in real life . The other scopes are set up for a locked in focus for the masses , this one lets you adjust for each individuals eyes . So people when asking yourself should I get this one or the cheaper one ???? think about this..... how many times have you gone through $150 with a tank of gas thats gone in less than a week with going to dinner and the movies added in ????..Them items are gone now but invested here will last for years and give you a great viewing experience every time you look through it instead of saying , I wish i could see a little farther and what is that over there ? ....I can tell you its a rabbit now for sure ...I hope this helps some of you in your decision.'
B001C74GM8|4977|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing.. I wish it came in \"\"black\"\" but with that said.. the OD Green is better looking than the pictures. Once wrapped with ghillie.. it matters not. I actually thought I might been disappointed with this purchase. \"\"IF\"\" it remains working as it has at the start.. it was well worth the low cost.Note: Mine says 3 year warranty not lifetime.. which was one of the buying factors. Nor did I recieve a mail in warranty card in the box. I did fill one out at their website and will hang onto that information along with the receipt if needed in the future! They say warranty only good if you return it within the first 30 days. I wont take away a star for this because this scope still has me grining and owning the night as advertised.'"
B001C74GM8|5614|'5.0,My second night scope.  First was in 2004 and did not compare to this one.I am planning on using it for night pellet rifle &#34;Ratting&#34; - look it up on youtube.  It works well for about 150 feet and even better with an IR flashlight.  Is adjustable for L/R and elevation.  You can turn the built in IR and crosshair on/off using the optional remote switch.I was playing with it around the neighborhood - not attached to anything, and you can see animals eyes reflect back at you.  I can\\t wait.  Definitely worth the purchase.  If you are going to use it for night time boar hunting, I am not sure you will have the magnification for distance as it is only a 1.5x , but for my purpose, it is perfect.'
B001C74GM8|2199023259142|"'5.0,OK, I had this in my Amazon Basket. The price dropped to 389.99 W No Tax or Shipping. As I was inpro the price jumped back to 399.99. It was reduced less than a day here so; I bought from B&H.PhotoVideo; online store instead. 389.99 W No Tax or Shipping. B&H; is awesome and I had it well packaged and within 2 days.Now, I have been a US Marine for 23 years. I am getting out of the game due to combat injuries, Left leg full of metal ect. I have used Uncle Sams\ NV platforms for years. NV Scopes on .50 Cal, Aviation Helmet NV Goggles for aviation ops ect. The latest Generation stuff available.I was very skeptical. I couldn\t afford 5, 10, 15 grand or more so I gave this a try. It had good reviews. Of course it\s not comparable to what I was provided by Gov. but I was pleasantly surprised. So far it\s well built. The night vision works. I have no black, dark or void spots whatsoever. I am extremely happy with this product, for the money.No regrets so far.I have taken it out and played with it. I bought it for my personal M4 platform in 5.56. I am still trying to figure if I am going to have to zero it at night or not. The reticle is red on a green field and reticle intensity is adjustable. This is not a scope I would want to use busting into a drug cartels compound but, in a civilian defensive mode it is a nice tool to have. For killing insurgent deer and wild boar and stuff, it should work nicely. Yea baby, eat more meat! Most of my shooting is precision shooting and practice. I may try to hunt pigs and coyotes at night if it\s legal. I need to check local laws on night hunting first.Something I noticed, When there is heavy brush or bush, trees and stuff up close, it tends to wash out the picture some. Only with the IR light on. Too much light reflecting. It\s easy to flip off the IR though and go into a more passive NV mode without Infrared Assist.After I zero it and shoot a few hundred rounds at night I will weigh in and give my opinion again. I hope this review helps someone else. Have fun, Be Safe, and Semper Fidelis! \"\"always faithful\"\"'"
B001C74GM8|2199023259774|'2.0,Got the NVRS in several weeks ago, bore sighted and laser sighted it in at the house at 60 yrds. Due to all the rain and snow didn\t get to the range until today. About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

B001C74GM8|13194139542493|'5.0,I did my research before purchasing this scope. I read the few customer reviews here on Amazon and then hit google to find more reviews. I read every one I could find.One of my big requirements were that I wanted something that used AA or AAA batteries and this fit the bill.I do not have this mounted yet, so I\\ve been using it as a monocle. A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night. It was a clear evening so I assume there was a ton of ambient natural IR light, but I was amazed!So far this was money well spent, this thing is fantastic!This was only the first part of my test I\\ll update my review as time goes on.'
B001C74GM8|13194139544248|'2.0,Got the NVRS in several weeks ago, bore sighted and laser sighted it in at the house at 60 yrds. Due to all the rain and snow didn\t get to the range until today. About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good.

B001C74GM8|21990232560475|'5.0,My second night scope.  First was in 2004 and did not compare to this one.I am planning on using it for night pellet rifle &#34;Ratting&#34; - look it up on youtube.  It works well for about 150 feet and even better with an IR flashlight.  Is adjustable for L/R and elevation.  You can turn the built in IR and crosshair on/off using the optional remote switch.I was playing with it around the neighborhood - not attached to anything, and you can see animals eyes reflect back at you.  I can\\t wait.  Definitely worth the purchase.  If you are going to use it for night time boar hunting, I am not sure you will have the magnification for distance as it is only a 1.5x , but for my purpose, it is perfect.'

I couldn\t afford 5, 10, 15 grand or more so I gave this a try. It had good reviews. Of course it\s not comparable to what I was provided by Gov. but I was pleasantly surprised. So far it\s well built. The night vision works. I have no black, dark or void spots whatsoever. I am extremely happy with this product, for the money.No regrets so far.I have taken it out and played with it. I bought it for my personal M4 platform in 5.56. I am still trying to figure if I am going to have to zero it at night or not. The reticle is red on a green field and reticle intensity is adjustable. This is not a scope I would want to use busting into a drug cartels compound but, in a civilian defensive mode it is a nice tool to have. For killing insurgent deer and wild boar and stuff, it should work nicely. Yea baby, eat more meat! Most of my shooting is precision shooting and practice. I may try to hunt pigs and coyotes at night if it\s legal. I need to check local laws on night hunting first.Something I noticed, When there is heavy brush or bush, trees and stuff up close, it tends to wash out the picture some. Only with the IR light on. Too much light reflecting. It\s easy to flip off the IR though and go into a more passive NV mode without Infrared Assist.After I zero it and shoot a few hundred rounds at night I will weigh in and give my opinion again.

B001C74GM8|30786325586883|'5.0,It is what it is...  for the money it is exactly what you paid for.  Unless you have a buddy who has a better Night Vision scope... you will think its Awesome.  I now can see what goes &#34;bump in the night&#34; without giving away my position with a flash light. My only real complaint is the color... its not that it is a ugly color green, its just it would look so much better if it matched my M4.  but comes off in seconds to switch out with a red dot or something else.  It def looks like a thousand dollar scope, though. Also, the weight in not bad on the rifle,  what the hell... you can see in the dark.  Just be carful of your eye... the first night I had it I was walking my property for about a half hour because it was so cool, but when I came back indoors my eye was cloudy for 10 mins or so. lol  but all in all, its Bad Ass!'
B001C74GM8|30786325587610|'2.0,Got the NVRS in several weeks ago, bore sighted and laser sighted it in at the house at 60 yrds. Due to all the rain and snow didn\t get to the range until today. About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

B001C74GM8|810|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing.. I wish it came in \"\"black\"\" but with that said.. the OD Green is better looking than the pictures. Once wrapped with ghillie.. it matters not. I actually thought I might been disappointed with this purchase. \"\"IF\"\" it remains working as it has at the start.. it was well worth the low cost.Note: Mine says 3 year warranty not lifetime.. which was one of the buying factors. Nor did I recieve a mail in warranty card in the box. I did fill one out at their website and will hang onto that information along with the receipt if needed in the future! They say warranty only good if you return it within the first 30 days. I wont take away a star for this because this scope still has me grining and owning the night as advertised.'"

B001C74GM8|6597069768801|'5.0,I did my research before purchasing this scope. I read the few customer reviews here on Amazon and then hit google to find more reviews. I read every one I could find.One of my big requirements were that I wanted something that used AA or AAA batteries and this fit the bill.I do not have this mounted yet, so I\\ve been using it as a monocle. A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night. It was a clear evening so I assume there was a ton of ambient natural IR light, but I was amazed!So far this was money well spent, this thing is fantastic!This was only the first part of my test I\\ll update my review as time goes on.'

About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after.

B001C74GM8|7585|'5.0,It is what it is...  for the money it is exactly what you paid for.  Unless you have a buddy who has a better Night Vision scope... you will think its Awesome.  I now can see what goes &#34;bump in the night&#34; without giving away my position with a flash light. My only real complaint is the color... its not that it is a ugly color green, its just it would look so much better if it matched my M4.  but comes off in seconds to switch out with a red dot or something else.  It def looks like a thousand dollar scope, though. Also, the weight in not bad on the rifle,  what the hell... you can see in the dark.  Just be carful of your eye... the first night I had it I was walking my property for about a half hour because it was so cool, but when I came back indoors my eye was cloudy for 10 mins or so. lol  but all in all, its Bad Ass!'
B001C74GM8|2199023256420|'5.0,I did my research before purchasing this scope. I read the few customer reviews here on Amazon and then hit google to find more reviews. I read every one I could find.One of my big requirements were that I wanted something that used AA or AAA batteries and this fit the bill.I do not have this mounted yet, so I\\ve been using it as a monocle. A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night. It was a clear evening so I assume there was a ton of ambient natural IR light, but I was amazed!So far this was money well spent, this thing is fantastic!This was only the first part of my test I\\ll update my review as time goes on.'

It was reduced less than a day here so; I bought from B&H.PhotoVideo; online store instead. 389.99 W No Tax or Shipping. B&H; is awesome and I had it well packaged and within 2 days.Now, I have been a US Marine for 23 years. I am getting out of the game due to combat injuries, Left leg full of metal ect. I have used Uncle Sams\ NV platforms for years. NV Scopes on .50 Cal, Aviation Helmet NV Goggles for aviation ops ect. The latest Generation stuff available.I was very skeptical. I couldn\t afford 5, 10, 15 grand or more so I gave this a try. It had good reviews. Of course it\s not comparable to what I was provided by Gov. but I was pleasantly surprised. So far it\s well built. The night vision works. I have no black, dark or void spots whatsoever. I am extremely happy with this product, for the money.No regrets so far.I have taken it out and played with it. I bought it for my personal M4 platform in 5.56. I am still trying to figure if I am going to have to zero it at night or not. The reticle is red on a green field and reticle intensity is adjustable. This is not a scope I would want to use busting into a drug cartels compound but, in a civilian defensive mode it is a nice tool to have. For killing insurgent deer and wild boar and stuff, it should work nicely. Yea baby, eat more meat! Most of my shooting is precision shooting and practice. I may try to hunt pigs and coyotes at night if it\s legal. I need to check local laws on night hunting first.Something I noticed, When there is heavy brush or bush, trees and stuff up close, it tends to wash out the picture some. Only with the IR light on. Too much light reflecting. It\s easy to flip off the IR though and go into a more passive NV mode without Infrared Assist.After I zero it and shoot a few hundred rounds at night I will weigh in and give my opinion again. I hope this review helps someone else. Have fun, Be Safe, and Semper Fidelis! \"\"always faithful\"\"'"

B001C74GM8|13194139535973|"'5.0,The scope is smaller and lighter than most Gen 1 says it all. I \"\"think\"\" it\\\\s the smallest rifle scope for gen 1 users at the present time and lightest. Under 2 pounds, you still notice the weight. Very well constructed from what I have seen in the VERY short time I have had this unit.It does as it is designed to do. See in total darkness with IR or with Starlight/Moonlight. Although it is only a 42mm lens with little to no magnification, it works great under 100 yards and can pickup images moving a few hundred yards away. What more do you want at this price range? There is a slight fisheye effect on the edges with no effect on what your actually looking at. The red reticle on mine can be adjusted from overly bright to off.Some things to note.. if your in heavy woods the IR is about useless.. your going to reflect off nearby trees, limbs and bushes. With that said.. without the IR and in heavy wood and overcast I was still able to see pretty well out to 50 yards or so. Turning on the IR is a definate daylight setting up to 75-100 yards if nothing interferes with your path. Ofcourse you lose your natural night sight and walk around like a cyclops for awhile after. (expected)Small enough to mount on M4 carry handle and allow use of see-thru mounts for iron sights. Uses AA batteries for simplicity. The case which it comes in also serves as a scope cover when mounted to rifle, well made. What\\\\s not to like at this price range? If but one thing..

B001C74GM8|13194139536448|'4.0,I had two of the 1.5 x 42 yukon scopes and they are ok if you know what to expect out of a gen 1 tube and $400 also if you can get past the ugly green that is different colors in different spots (why not black guys?) . The problem was that besides the normal fish eye effect that is common with gen 1 scopes , it was lacking in the focusing department . Yes it had the back ring but that really is just for the cross hairs to clear up and not be doubled while looking at them . I could see some what clearly with the cover down at very short range inside the house ( like 10 feet ) when you opened the cover it was a total blur . Outside I would really have to fight the double cross hair problem when looking at something specific ,I do not wear glasses nor need them... I saw a rabbit one time at about 30 yds and knew it was a rabbit but I really could not identify it clearly . Deer or hog size game you can see but you are limited to under 100 yds trust me 75 should be the limit really . I searched for a scope that could clear things up and be reasonable . I searched for days and just got sick of hunting for one that wasn\\t $1500 or more . I also learned through my research that Sightmark owns every company I was looking at ( yukon , pulsar and one other company its not ATN ) also that listings of gen 1+ and 2 gen + means nothing other then current production tubes . The life time warranty is only for 3 years on yukon and sightmark scopes tubes which is better than any other company . I heard too many hit and misses with ATN products and decided to avoid them . I looked at this scope Yukon Nvrs Tactical 2.5X50 with Internal Focusing Night Vision Rifle scope,and saw it had an adjustable objective ring in addition to the rear ring adjustment for $150 more..and it also has is a weaver rail on the other side (not shown) to mount an IR light or laser that the 1.5 does not have and its BLACK!!!! way better looking . I took it out at night with 3/4 moon and minimum cloud cover....OMG it is totally worth the extra $150 looking at the same places that I did with the two other 1.5 x 42 scopes. It was the difference between being ok with a product or totally satisfied and happy .The 1.5 x 42 only gives you a small center that is useful... the outer edges are of no use and that is a known issue with gen 1 so I understood . This scope maybe due to the focusing objective ring may have helped in correcting the problem a little because I have much better edge to edge clarity . Now when I look at something that might be blurred I just roll the front ring and its clear as can be. My cross hairs are on point after a turn with the rear ring .The person that stated he could not get it sighted in through the pin hole ..well your not suppose to do it that way, it even tells you in the instructions to do it at night with the cover up. I have not sighted it in yet but the others were done that way with no problems and if this one don\\t then I will let you know . The adjustments knobs have positive clicks and seem to track well .The IR light that is mounted on the scope is decent for about 75 to 100 yds and I think a added IR light would really light things up after looking at some videos, so I ordered one from here and am still waiting for it from China ...There is a great review on the 2.5 x 50 scope on youtube showing you what you will actually see when using the scope, you just have to put yukon scope in the search and it shows a dirt road with power poles . The image in the video does not do it Justis compared to actually looking through it in real life . The other scopes are set up for a locked in focus for the masses , this one lets you adjust for each individuals eyes . So people when asking yourself should I get this one or the cheaper one ???? think about this..... how many times have you gone through $150 with a tank of gas thats gone in less than a week with going to dinner and the movies added in ????..Them items are gone now but invested here will last for years and give you a great viewing experience every time you look through it instead of saying , I wish i could see a little farther and what is that over there ? ....I can tell you its a rabbit now for sure ...I hope this helps some of you in your decision.'
B001C74GM8|13194139536813|'5.0,I did my research before purchasing this scope. I read the few customer reviews here on Amazon and then hit google to find more reviews. I read every one I could find.One of my big requirements were that I wanted something that used AA or AAA batteries and this fit the bill.I do not have this mounted yet, so I\\ve been using it as a monocle. A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night. It was a clear evening so I assume there was a ton of ambient natural IR light, but I was amazed!So far this was money well spent, this thing is fantastic!This was only the first part of my test I\\ll update my review as time goes on.'

It works well for about 150 feet and even better with an IR flashlight.  Is adjustable for L/R and elevation.  You can turn the built in IR and crosshair on/off using the optional remote switch.I was playing with it around the neighborhood - not attached to anything, and you can see animals eyes reflect back at you.  I can\\t wait.  Definitely worth the purchase.  If you are going to use it for night time boar hunting, I am not sure you will have the magnification for distance as it is only a 1.5x , but for my purpose, it is perfect.'

B001C74GM8|24189255812305|'2.0,Got the NVRS in several weeks ago, bore sighted and laser sighted it in at the house at 60 yrds. Due to all the rain and snow didn\t get to the range until today. About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'

B001C74GM8|26388279070699|'4.0,I had two of the 1.5 x 42 yukon scopes and they are ok if you know what to expect out of a gen 1 tube and $400 also if you can get past the ugly green that is different colors in different spots (why not black guys?) . The problem was that besides the normal fish eye effect that is common with gen 1 scopes , it was lacking in the focusing department . Yes it had the back ring but that really is just for the cross hairs to clear up and not be doubled while looking at them . I could see some what clearly with the cover down at very short range inside the house ( like 10 feet ) when you opened the cover it was a total blur . Outside I would really have to fight the double cross hair problem when looking at something specific ,I do not wear glasses nor need them... I saw a rabbit one time at about 30 yds and knew it was a rabbit but I really could not identify it clearly . Deer or hog size game you can see but you are limited to under 100 yds trust me 75 should be the limit really . I searched for a scope that could clear things up and be reasonable . I searched for days and just got sick of hunting for one that wasn\\t $1500 or more . I also learned through my research that Sightmark owns every company I was looking at ( yukon , pulsar and one other company its not ATN ) also that listings of gen 1+ and 2 gen + means nothing other then current production tubes . The life time warranty is only for 3 years on yukon and sightmark scopes tubes which is better than any other company . I heard too many hit and misses with ATN products and decided to avoid them . I looked at this scope Yukon Nvrs Tactical 2.5X50 with Internal Focusing Night Vision Rifle scope,and saw it had an adjustable objective ring in addition to the rear ring adjustment for $150 more..and it also has is a weaver rail on the other side (not shown) to mount an IR light or laser that the 1.5 does not have and its BLACK!!!! way better looking . I took it out at night with 3/4 moon and minimum cloud cover....OMG it is totally worth the extra $150 looking at the same places that I did with the two other 1.5 x 42 scopes. It was the difference between being ok with a product or totally satisfied and happy .The 1.5 x 42 only gives you a small center that is useful... the outer edges are of no use and that is a known issue with gen 1 so I understood . This scope maybe due to the focusing objective ring may have helped in correcting the problem a little because I have much better edge to edge clarity . Now when I look at something that might be blurred I just roll the front ring and its clear as can be. My cross hairs are on point after a turn with the rear ring .The person that stated he could not get it sighted in through the pin hole ..well your not suppose to do it that way, it even tells you in the instructions to do it at night with the cover up. I have not sighted it in yet but the others were done that way with no problems and if this one don\\t then I will let you know . The adjustments knobs have positive clicks and seem to track well .The IR light that is mounted on the scope is decent for about 75 to 100 yds and I think a added IR light would really light things up after looking at some videos, so I ordered one from here and am still waiting for it from China ...There is a great review on the 2.5 x 50 scope on youtube showing you what you will actually see when using the scope, you just have to put yukon scope in the search and it shows a dirt road with power poles . The image in the video does not do it Justis compared to actually looking through it in real life . The other scopes are set up for a locked in focus for the masses , this one lets you adjust for each individuals eyes . So people when asking yourself should I get this one or the cheaper one ???? think about this..... how many times have you gone through $150 with a tank of gas thats gone in less than a week with going to dinner and the movies added in ????..Them items are gone now but invested here will last for years and give you a great viewing experience every time you look through it instead of saying , I wish i could see a little farther and what is that over there ? ....I can tell you its a rabbit now for sure ...I hope this helps some of you in your decision.'

It was reduced less than a day here so; I bought from B&H.PhotoVideo; online store instead. 389.99 W No Tax or Shipping. B&H; is awesome and I had it well packaged and within 2 days.Now, I have been a US Marine for 23 years. I am getting out of the game due to combat injuries, Left leg full of metal ect. I have used Uncle Sams\ NV platforms for years. NV Scopes on .50 Cal, Aviation Helmet NV Goggles for aviation ops ect. The latest Generation stuff available.I was very skeptical. I couldn\t afford 5, 10, 15 grand or more so I gave this a try. It had good reviews. Of course it\s not comparable to what I was provided by Gov. but I was pleasantly surprised. So far it\s well built. The night vision works. I have no black, dark or void spots whatsoever. I am extremely happy with this product, for the money.No regrets so far.I have taken it out and played with it. I bought it for my personal M4 platform in 5.56. I am still trying to figure if I am going to have to zero it at night or not. The reticle is red on a green field and reticle intensity is adjustable. This is not a scope I would want to use busting into a drug cartels compound but, in a civilian defensive mode it is a nice tool to have. For killing insurgent deer and wild boar and stuff, it should work nicely. Yea baby, eat more meat! Most of my shooting is precision shooting and practice. I may try to hunt pigs and coyotes at night if it\s legal. I need to check local laws on night hunting first.Something I noticed, When there is heavy brush or bush, trees and stuff up close, it tends to wash out the picture some. Only with the IR light on. Too much light reflecting. It\s easy to flip off the IR though and go into a more passive NV mode without Infrared Assist.After I zero it and shoot a few hundred rounds at night I will weigh in and give my opinion again. I hope this review helps someone else. Have fun, Be Safe, and Semper Fidelis! \"\"always faithful\"\"'"
B001C74GM8|26388279074907|'5.0,So far, I like it. I\\ve tested it out indoors. had a small night light for the ambient light. i had to flip on the IR setting. it works well with low light. looking forward to hog hunting'
B001C74GM8|28587302324252|'1.0,I have had 4 of these scopes the first being ordered in Oct 2012 - ALL 4 have failed - the first would not power up - the second the cross hairs started &#34;walking&#34; on the range while trying to zero - the third also failed to power up and the forth failed on the first shot at the range - AR 15 platform - shooting XM193 55gr 5.56mm for 50 then to 100 yard range - never got to make a 100 yard shot and followed directions exactly - I believe you are much more likely to get one that fails to operate than you are one that functions as advertised - trying to get a monetary refund as of this writing'
B001C74GM8|28587302332849|'5.0,I did my research before purchasing this scope. I read the few customer reviews here on Amazon and then hit google to find more reviews. I read every one I could find.One of my big requirements were that I wanted something that used AA or AAA batteries and this fit the bill.I do not have this mounted yet, so I\\ve been using it as a monocle. A few nights I took this out in my backyard and was using it without the IR illuminator. I was amazed at how well I could see the tree line, 35-50 yards away. I could clearly make out details and even spotted a silently grazing deer. Only then did I hit the IR illuminator and lit him up like day time. It looked like a spot light... and he had no idea.Let me reiterate: without the illuminator I was able to see into the dark shadowy night. It was a clear evening so I assume there was a ton of ambient natural IR light, but I was amazed!So far this was money well spent, this thing is fantastic!This was only the first part of my test I\\ll update my review as time goes on.'

B001C74GM8|1311|'2.0,Got the NVRS in several weeks ago, bore sighted and laser sighted it in at the house at 60 yrds. Due to all the rain and snow didn\t get to the range until today. About 11am with moderate over cast set up at 100 yrds on fixed rifle mount. Rifle my 7th home build AR this one in 5.56, shooting American Eagle 55 gr for zerro. Fired 2 rounds iron sight went checked, dead on in the 3 inch orange target. Went back checked NVRS against iron sights did little adjustment. Following their instructions with the cover closed using the day time peep hole you can barely  see the red cross hairs but you can see them. Fired one round went checked I was happy only a few inches off the orange. Went back did not recheck zerro. Fired another round went down checked it was a good 18 inches high and 14 inches right. Went back checked zerro saw it was off, made sure all lugs and screws on mount was tight and re zeroed. Bang back close to the orange. Went back checked zerro before firing and saw it was off again. Would not re zerro this time.Would not stay zeroed .going to try another one and give it another chance. I think if the next one holds zerro it will be worth the money. View was better than I expected for zeroing day time through peep hole. When I zeroed it at home at night the field of view at the 60 yards was good. Hoping for the best on the next one for this varmagedon rifle.'
